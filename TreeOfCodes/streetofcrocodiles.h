AUGUST

IN JULY my father went to take the waters and left me, with my mother 
and elder brother, a prey to the blinding white heat of the summer days. 
Dizzy with light, we dipped into that enormous book of holidays, its 
pages blazing with sunshine and scented with the sweet melting pulp of 
golden pears.
 On those luminous mornings Adela returned from the market, like 
Pomona emerging from the flames of day, spilling from her basket the 
colourful beauty of the sun-the shiny pink cherries full of juice under 
their transparent skins, the mysterious black morellos that smelled so 
much better than they tasted; apricots in whose golden pulp lay the core 
of long afternoons. And next to that pure poetry of fruit, she unloaded 
sides of meat with their keyboard of ribs swollen with energy and 
strength, and seaweeds of vegetables like dead octopuses and squids-the 
raw material of meals with a yet undefined taste, the vegetative and 
terrestrial ingredients of dinner, exuding a wild and rustic smell.
 The dark first floor apartment of the house in Market Square was 
shot through each day by the naked heat of summer: the silence of the 
shimmering streaks of air, the squares of brightness dreaming their 
intense dreams on the floor; the sound of a barrel-organ rising from the 
deepest golden vein of day; two or three bars of a chorus, played on a 
distant piano over and over again, melting in the sun on the white 
pavement, lost in the fire of high noon.
 After tidying up, Adela would plunge the rooms into semi-darkness 
by drawing down the linen blinds. All colours immediately fell an octave 
lower, the room filled with shadows, as if it had sunk to the bottom of 
the sea and the light was reflected in mirrors of green water- and the 
heat of the day began to breathe on the blinds as they stirred slightly 
in their day-dreams.
  On Saturday afternoons I used to go for a walk with my mother. 
From the dusk of the hallway, we stepped at once into the brightness of 
the day. The passers-by, bathed in melting gold, had their eyes half 
closed against the glare, as if they were drenched with honey. Upper 
lips were drawn back, exposing the teeth. Everyone in this golden day 
wore that grimace of heat-as if the sun had forced his worshippers to 
wear identical masks of gold. The old and the young, women and children, 
greeted each other with these masks, painted on their faces with thick 
gold paint; they smiled at each other's pagan faces-the barbaric smiles 
of Bacchus.

 Market Square was empty and white hot, swept by hot winds like a 
biblical desert. The thorny acacias, growing in this emptiness, looked 
with their bright leaves like the trees on old tapestries. Although 
there was no breath of wind, they rustled their foliage in a theatrical 
gesture, as if wanting to display the elegance of the silver lining of 
their leaves that resembled the fox-fur lining of a nobleman's coat. The 
old houses, worn smooth by the winds of innumerable days, played tricks 
with the reflections of the atmosphere, with echoes and memories of 
colours scattered in the depth of the cloudless sky. It seemed as if 
whole generations of summer days, like patient stonemasons cleaning the 
mildewed plaster from old facades, had removed the deceptive varnish, 
revealing more and more clearly the true face of the houses, the 
features that fate had given them and life had shaped for them from the 
inside. Now the windows, blinded by the glare of the empty square, had 
fallen asleep; the balconies declared their emptiness to heaven; the 
open doorways smelt of coolness and wine.

 A bunch of ragamuffins, sheltering in a corner of the square from 
the flaming broom of the heat, beleaguered a piece of wall, throwing 
buttons and coins at it over and over again, as if wishing to read in 
the horoscope of those metal discs the real secret written in the 
hieroglyphics of cracks and scratched lines. Apart from them, the square 
was deserted. One expected that, any minute, the Samaritan's donkey, led 
by the bridle, would stop in front of the wine-merchant's vaulted 
doorway and that two servants would carefully ease a sick man from the 
red-hot saddle and carry him slowly up the cool stairs to the floor 
above, already redolent of the Sabbath.

 Thus my mother and I ambled along the two sunny sides of Market 
Square, guiding our broken shadows along the houses as over a keyboard. 
Under our soft steps the squares of the paving stones slowly filed past-
some the pale pink of human skin, some golden, some blue-grey, all flat, 
warm and velvety in the sun, like sun-dials, trodden to the point of 
obliteration, into blessed nothingness.

 And finally on the corner of Stryjska Street we passed within the 
shadow of the chemist's shop. A large jar of raspberry juice in the wide 
window symbolised the coolness of balms which can relieve all kinds of 
pain. After we passed a few more houses, the street ceased to maintain 
any pretence of urbanity like a man returning to his little village who, 
piece by piece, strips off his Sunday best, slowly changing back into a 
peasant as he gets closer to his home.
 The suburban houses were sinking, windows and all, into the 
exuberant tangle of blossom in their little gardens. Overlooked by the 
light of day, weeds and wild flowers of all kinds luxuriated quietly, 
glad of the interval for dreams beyond the margin of time on the borders 
of an endless day. An enormous sunflower, lifted on a powerful stem and 
suffering from hypertrophy, clad in the yellow mourning of the last 
sorrowful days of its life, bent under the weight of its monstrous 
girth. But the naive, suburban bluebells and unpretentious dimity 
flowers stood helpless in their starched pink and white shifts, 
indifferent to the sunflower's tragedy.

II

A tangled thicket of grasses, weeds and thistles crackled in the fire of 
the afternoon. The sleeping garden was resonant with flies. The golden 
field of stubble shouted in the sun like a tawny cloud of locusts; in 
the thick rain of fire the crickets screamed; seed pods exploded softly 
like grasshoppers.
  And over by the fence the sheepskin of grass lifted in a hump, as 
if the garden had turned over in its sleep, its broad, peasant back 
rising and falling as it breathed on the stillness of the earth. There 
the untidy, feminine ripeness of August had expanded into enormous, 
impenetrable, clumps of burdocks spreading their sheets of leafy tin, 
their luxuriant tongues of fleshy greenery. There, those protuberant bur 
clumps spread themselves, like resting peasant women, half enveloped in 
their own swirling skirts. There, the garden offered free of charge the 
cheapest fruits of wild lilac, the heady aquavit of mint and all kinds 
of August trash. But on the other side of the fence, behind that jungle 
of summer in which the stupidity of weeds reigned unchecked, there was a 
rubbish heap on which thistles grew in wild profusion. No one knew that 
there, on that refuse dump, the month of August had chosen to hold that 
year its pagan orgies. There, pushed against the fence and hidden by the 
elders, stood the bed of the halfwit girl, Touya, as we all called her. 
On a heap of discarded junk of old saucepans, abandoned single shoes and 
chunks of plaster, stood a bed, painted green, propped up on two bricks 
where one leg was missing.

 The air over that midden, wild with the heat, cut through by the 
lightning of shiny horseflies, driven mad by the sun, crackled, as if 
filled with invisible rattles, exciting one to frenzy.

 Touya sits hunched up among the yellow bedding and odd rags, her 
large head covered by a mop of tangled black hair. Her face works like 
the bellows of an accordion. Every now and then a sorrowful grimace 
folds it into a thousand vertical pleats, but astonishment soons 
straightens it out again, ironing out the folds, revealing the chinks of 
small eyes and damp guns with yellow teeth under snout-like, fleshy 
lips. Hours pass, filled with heat and boredom; Touya chatters in a 
monotone, dozes, mumbles softly and coughs. Her immobile frame is 
covered by a thick cloak of flies. But suddenly the whole heap of dirty 
rags begins to move, as if stirred by the scratching of a litter of 
newlyborn rats. The flies wake up in fright and rise in a huge, 
furiously buzzing cloud, filled with coloured light reflected from the 
sun. And while the rags slip to the ground and spread out over the 
rubbish heap, like frightened rats, a form emerges and reveals itself: 
the dark halfnaked idiot girl rises slowly to her feet and stands like a 
pagan idol, on short childish legs; her neck swells with anger, and from 
her face, red with fury, on which the arabesques of bulging veins stand 
out as in a primitive painting, comes forth a hoarse animal scream, 
originating deep in the lungs hidden in that half-animal, half-divine 
breast. The sun-dried thistles shout, the plantains swell and boast 
their shameless flesh, the weeds salivate with glistening poison, and 
the half-wit girl, hoarse with shouting, convulsed with madness, presses 
her fleshy belly in an excess of lust against the trunk of an elder 
which groans softly under the insistent pressure of that libidinous 
passion, incited by the whole ghastly chorus to hideous unnatural 
fertility.

 Touya's mother Maria hired herself to housewives to scrub floors. 
She was a small saffron-yellow woman, and it was with saffron that she 
wiped the floors, the deal tables, the benches and the bannisters which 
she scrubbed in the homes of the poor.

 Once Adela took me to the old woman's house. It was early in the 
morning when we entered the small blue-walled room, with its mud floor, 
lying in a patch of bright yellow sunlight in the still of the morning 
broken only by the frighteningly loud ticking of a cottage clock on the 
wall. In a straw-filled chest lay the foolish Maria, white as a wafer 
and motionless like a glove from which a hand had been withdrawn. And, 
as if taking advantage of her sleep, the silence talked, the yellow, 
bright evil silence delivered its monologue, argued, and loudly spoke 
its vulgar maniacal soliloquy. Maria's time the time imprisoned in her 
soul-had left her and-terribly real-filled the room, vociferous and 
hellish in the bright silence of the morning, rising from the noisy mill 
of the clock like a cloud of bad flour, powdery flour, the stupid flour 
of madmen.

 III

In one of those cottages, surrounded by brown railings and submerged in 
the lush green of its garden, lived Aunt Agatha. Coming through the 
garden to visit her, we passed numerous coloured glass balls stuck on 
flimsy poles. In these pink, green and violet balls were enclosed bright 
shining worlds like the ideally happy pictures contained in the peerless 
perfection of soap bubbles.

 In the gloom of the hall, with its old lithographs, rotten with 
mildew and blind with age, we rediscovered a well-known smell. In that 
old familiar smell was contained a marvellously simple synthesis of the 
life of those people, the distillation of their race, the quality of 
their blood and the secret of their fate, imperceptibly mixed day by day 
with the passage of their own, private, time. The old, wise door, the 
silent witness of the entries and exits of mother, daughters, sons, 
whose dark sighs accompanied the comings and goings of those people, now 
opened noiselessly like the door of a wardrobe and we stepped into their 
life. They were sitting as if in the shadow of their own destiny and did 
not fight against it; with their first, clumsy gestures they revealed 
their secret to us. Besides, were we not related to them by blood and by 
fate?

 The room was dark and velvety from the royal blue wallpaper with 
its gold pattern, but even here the echo of the flaming day shimmered 
brassily on the picture frames, on door knobs and gilded borders, 
although it came through the filter of the dense greenery of the garden. 
From her chair against the wall, Aunt Agatha rose to greet us, tall and 
ample, her round white flesh blotchy with the rust of freckles. We sat 
down beside them, as on the verge of their lives, rather embarrassed by 
their defenseless surrender to us, and we drank water with rose syrup, a 
wonderful drink in which I found the deepest essence of that hot 
Saturday.

 My aunt was complaining. It was the principal burden of her 
conversation, the voice of that white and fertile flesh, floating as it 
were outside the boundaries of her person, held only loosely in the 
fetters of
 individual form, and, despite those fetters, ready to multiply, to 
scatter, branch out, and divide into a family. It was an almost 
selfpropagating fertility, a femininity without rein, morbidly 
expansive.

 It seemed as if the very whiff of masculinity, the smell of 
tobacco smoke, or a bachelor's joke, would spark off this feverish 
femininity and entice it to a lascivious virgin-birth. And in fact, all 
her complaints about her husband or her servants, all her worries about 
the children were only the caprices of her incompletely satisfied 
fertility, a logical extension of the rude, angry, lachrymose coquetry 
with which, to no purpose, she plagued her husband. Uncle Mark, small 
and hunched, with a face fallow of sex, sat in his grey bankruptcy, 
reconciled to his fate, in the shadow of a limitless contempt in which 
he seemed only to relax. His grey eyes reflected the distant glow of the 
garden, spreading in the window.

 Sometimes he tried with a feeble gesture to raise an objection, to 
resist, but the wave of self-sufficient femininity hurled aside that 
unimportant gesture, triumphantly passed him by, and drowned the feeble 
stirrings of male assertiveness under its broad flood.

 There was something tragic in that immoderate fertility; the 
misery of a creature fighting on the borders of nothingness and death, 
the heroism of womanhood triumphing by fertility over the shortcomings 
of nature, over the insufficiency of the male. But their offspring 
showed justification for that panic of maternity, of a passion for child 
bearing which became exhausted in ill-starred pregnancies, in an 
ephemereal generation of phantoms without blood or face.

 Lucy, the second eldest, now entered the room, her head 
overdeveloped for her child-like, plump body, her flesh white and 
delicate. She stretched out to me a small doll-like hand, a hand in bud, 
and blushed all over her face like a peony. Unhappy because of her 
blushes, which shamelessly revealed the secrets of menstruation, she 
closed her eyes and reddened even more deeply under the touch of the 
most indifferent question, for she saw in each a secret allusion to her 
most sensitive maidenhood.
  Emil, the eldest of the cousins, with a fair moustache in a face 
from which life seemed to have washed away all expression, was walking 
up and down the room, his hands in the pockets of his voluminous 
trousers.

 His elegant expensive clothes bore the imprint of the exotic 
countries he had visited. His pale, flabby face, seemed from day to day 
to lose its outline, to become a white blank wall with a pale network of 
veins, like lines on an old map occasionally stirred by the fading 
memories of a stormy and wasted life.

 He was a master of card tricks, he smoked long, noble pipes and 
smelled strangely of distant lands. With his gaze wandering over old 
memories, he told curious stories, which at some point would suddenly 
stop, disintegrate, and blow away.

 My eyes followed him nostalgically, and I wished he would notice 
me and liberate me from the tortures of boredom. And indeed, it seemed 
as if he gave me a wink before going into an adjoining room and I 
followed him there. He was sitting on a small low sofa, his crossed 
knees almost level with his head, which was bald like a billiard ball. 
It seemed as if it were only his clothes that had been thrown, crumpled 
and empty, over a chair. His face seemed like the breath of a face-a 
smudge which an unknown passer-by had left in the air. In his white, 
blue-enamelled hands he was holding a wallet and looking at something in 
it.

 From the mist of his face, the protruding white of a pale eye 
emerged with difficulty, enticing me with a wink. I felt an irresistable 
sympathy for Emil.

 He took me between his knees and, shuffling some photographs in 
front of my eyes as if they were a pack of cards, he showed me naked 
women and boys in strange positions. I stood leaning against him looking 
at those delicate human bodies with distant, unseeing eyes, when all of 
a sudden the fluid of an obscure excitement with which the air seemed 
charged, reached me and pierced me with a shiver of uneasiness, a wave 
of sudden comprehension. But meanwhile that ghost of a smile which had 
appeared under Emil's soft and beautiful moustache, the seed of desire 
which had shown in a pulsating vein on his temple, the tenseness which 
for a moment had kept his features concentrated, all fell away again and 
his face receded into indifference and became absent and finally faded 
away altogether.


VISITATION

 ALREADY for some time our town had been sinking into the perpetual greyness 
of dusk, had become affected at the edges by a rash of shadows, by fluffy mildew 
and by moss the dull colour of iron.
	Hardly was it freed from the brown smoke and the mists of the morning, than 
the day turned into a lowering amber afternoon, became for a brief moment 
transparent, taking the golden colour of ale, only to ascend under the multiple 
fantastic domes of vast, colour filled nights.
	We lived in Market Square, in one of those dark houses with empty blind 
looks, so difficult to distinguish one from the other.
	This gave endless possibilities for mistakes. For, once you had entered the 
wrong doorway and set foot on the wrong staircase, you were liable to find yourself 
in a real labyrinth of unfamiliar apartments and balconies, and unexpected doors 
opening on to strange empty courtyards, and you forgot the initial object of the 
expedition, only to recall it days later after numerous strange and complicated 
adventures, on regaining the family home in the grey light of dawn.
	Full of large wardrobes, vast sofas, faded mirrors and cheap artificial 
palms, our apartment sank ever deeper into a state of neglect owing to the 
indolence of my mother, who spent most of her time in the shop, and the 
carelessness of slim-legged Adela who, without anyone to supervise her, spent her 
days in front of a mirror, endlessly making up and leaving everywhere tufts of 
combed out hair, brushes, odd slippers and discarded corsets.
	No one ever knew exactly how many rooms we had in our flat, because no one 
ever remembered how many of them were let to strangers. Often one would by chance 
open the door to one of these forgotten rooms to find it empty; the lodger had 
moved out a long time ago. In the drawers, untouched for months, one would make 
unexpected discoveries.
	In the downstairs rooms lived the shop-assistants and sometimes during the 
night we were awakened by their nightmares. In winter it would be still deep night 
when father went down to these cold and dark rooms, the light of his candle 
scattering flocks of shadows so that they fled sideways along the floor and up the 
walls; his task to wake the snoring men from their stone-hard sleep.
	In the light of the candle, which father left with them, they unwound 
themselves lazily from the dirty bedding, then, sitting on the edge of their beds, 
stuck out their bare and ugly feet and, with socks in their hands, abandoned 
themselves for a moment to the delights of yawning-a yawning crossing the borders 
of sensuous pleasure, leading to a painful cramp of the palate, almost to nausea.
	In the corners, large cockroaches sat immobile, hideously enlarged by their 
own shadows which the burning candle imposed on them and which remained attached to 
their flat, headless bodies when they suddenly ran off with weird, spider-like 
movements.
	At that time, my father's health began to fail. liven in the first weeks of 
this early winter, he would spend whole days in bed, surrounded by bottles of 
medicine and boxes of pills, and ledgers brought up to him from the shop. The 
bitter smell of illness settled like a rug in the room and the arabesques on the 
wallpaper loomed darker.
   In the evenings, when mother returned from the shop, father was often excited 
and inclined to argue.
   As he reproached her for inaccuracies in the accounts his cheeks became flushed 
and he became almost insane with anger. I remember more than once waking in the 
middle of the night to see him in his nightshirt, running in his bare feet up and 
down the leather sofa to demonstrate his irritation to my baffled mother.
   On other days he was calm and composed, completely absorbed in the account 
books, lost in a maze of complicated calculations.
   I can still see him in the light of the smoking lamp, crouched among his pillows 
under the large carved headboard of the bed, swaying backwards and forwards in 
silent meditation, his head making an enormous shadow on the wall.
   From time to time, he raised his eyes from the ledgers as if to come up for air, 
opened his mouth, smacked his lips with distaste as if his tongue were dry and 
bitter, and looked around helplessly, as if searching for something.
   It then sometimes happened that he quietly got out of bed and ran to the corner 
of the room, where an intimate instrument hung on the wall. It was a kind of hour-
glass shaped water-jar marked in ounces and filled with a dark fluid. My father 
attached himself to it with a long rubber hose as if with a gnarled, aching navel-
cord, and thus connected with the miserable apparatus, he became tense with 
concentration, his eyes darkened and an expression of suffering, or perhaps of 
forbidden pleasure, spread over his pale face.
   Then again came days of quiet, concentrated work, interrupted by lonely 
monologues. While he sat there in the light of the lamp among the pillows of the 
large bed, and the room grew enormous as the shadows above the lampshade merged 
with the deep city night beyond the windows, he felt, without looking, how the 
pullulating jungle of wallpaper, filled with whispers, lisping and hissing, closed 
in around him. He heard, without looking, a conspiracy of knowingly winking hidden 
eyes, of alert ears opening up among the flowers on the wall, of dark, smiling 
mouths.
   He then pretended to become ever more engrossed in his work, adding and 
calculating, trying not to betray the anger which rose in him and overcoming the 
temptation to throw himself blindly forward with a sudden shout to grab fistfuls of 
those curly arabesques, or of those sheaves of eyes and ears which swarmed out from 
the night and grew and multiplied, sprouting, with ever new ghostlike shoots and 
branches, from the womb of darkness. And he calmed down only when, in the morning 
with the ebb of night, the wallpaper wilted, shed its leaves and petals and thinned 
down autumnally, letting in the distant dawn.
   Then, among the twittering of wallpaper birds in the yellow wintry dawn, he 
would fall, for a few hours, into a heavy black sleep.
   For days, even for weeks, while he seemed to be engrossed in the complicated 
current accounts-his thoughts had been secretly plumbing the depths of his own 
entrails. He would hold his breath and listen. And when his gaze returned, pale and 
troubled, from that labyrinth, he calmed it with a smile. He did not wish to 
believe those assumptions and suggestions which oppressed him, and rejected them as 
absurd.
   In daytime, these were more like arguments and persuasions; long monotonous 
reasonings, conducted half aloud and with humorous interludes of teasing and 
banter. But at night these voices rose with greater passion. The demands were made 
more clearly and more loudly, and we heard him talk to God, as if begging for 
something or fighting against someone who made insistent claims and issued orders.
   Until one night that voice rose threateningly and irresistibly, demanding that 
he should bear witness to it with his mouth and with his entrails. And we heard the 
spirit enter into him as he rose from his bed, tall and growing in prophetic anger, 
choking with brash words which he emitted like a machine-gun. We heard the din of 
battle and father's groans, the groans of a titan with a broken hip, but still 
capable of wrath.
   I have never seen an Old Testament prophet, but at the sight of this man 
stricken by God's fire, sitting clumsily on an enormous china chamberpot behind a 
windmill of arms, a screen of desperate wrigglings over which there towered his 
voice, grown unfamiliar and hard, I understood the divine anger of saintly men.
   It was a dialogue as grim as the language of thunder. The jerkings of his arms 
cut the sky into pieces, and in the cracks there appeared the face of Jehovah 
swollen with anger and spitting out curses. Without looking, I saw him, the 
terrible Demiurge, as, resting on darkness as on Sinai, propping his powerful palms 
on the pelmet of the curtains, he pressed his enormous face against the upper panes 
of the window which flattened horribly his large fleshy nose.
   I heard my father's voice during the intermissions in these prophetic tirades. I 
heard the windows shake from the powerful growl of the swollen lips, mixed with the 
explosions of entreaties, laments and threats uttered by father.
   Sometimes the voices quietened down and grumbled softly like the nightly chatter 
of wind in a chimney, then again they exploded with a large, tumultuous noise, in a 
storm of sobs mixed with curses. Suddenly the window opened with a dark yawn and a 
sheet of darkness wafted across the room.
   In a flash of lightning I could see my father, his nightshirt unbuttoned, as, 
cursing terribly, he emptied with a masterful gesture the contents of the 
chamberpot into the darkness below.
My father was slowly fading, wilting before our eyes.
   Hunched amongst the enormous pillows, his grey hair standing wildly on end, he 
talked to himself in under-tones, engrossed in some complicated private business. 
It seemed as if his personality had split into a number of opposing and quarrelling 
selves; he argued loudly with himself, persuading forcibly and passionately, 
pleading and begging; then again he seemed to be presiding over a meeting of many 
interested parties whose views he tried to reconcile with a great show of energy 
and conviction. But every time these noisy meetings, during which tempers would 
rise violently, dissolved into curses, execrations, maledictions and insults.
   Then came a period of appeasement, of an interior calm, a blessed serenity of 
spirit. Again the great ledgers were spread on the bed, on the table, on the floor, 
and an almost monastic calm reigned in the light of the lamp, over the white 
bedding, over my father's grey, bowed head.
   But when mother returned late at night from the shop, father became animated, 
called her and showed her with great pride the wonderful, coloured transfers with 
which he had laboriously adorned the pages of the main ledger.
   About that time we noticed that father began to shrink from day to day like a 
nut drying inside the shell.
   This shrinking was not accompanied by any loss of strength. On the contrary, 
there seemed to be an improvement in his general state of health, in his humour and 
in his mobility.
   Now he often laughed loudly and gaily; sometimes he was almost overcome with 
laughter; at others, he would knock on the side of the bed and answer himself: 
"Come in," in various tones, for hours on end. From time to time, he scrambled down 
from the bed, climbed on top of the wardrobe and, crouching under the ceiling, 
sorted out old dust-covered odds and ends.
   Sometimes he put two chairs back to back and taking his weight on them, swung 
his legs backwards and forwards, looking with shining eyes for an expression of 
admiration and encouragement in our faces. It seemed as if he had become completely 
reconciled with God. Sometimes at night, the face of the bearded Demiurge would 
appear at the bedroom window, bathed in the dark purple glare of Bengal fire, but 
it only looked for a moment benevolently on my sleeping father whose melodious 
snoring seemed to wander far into the unknown regions of the world of sleep.
   During the long twilight afternoons of this winter, my father would spend hours 
rummaging in corners full of old junk, as if he were feverishly searching for 
something.
   And sometimes at dinner time, when we had all taken our places at the table, 
father would be missing. On such occasions, mother had to call "Jacob!" over and 
over again and knock her spoon against the table before he emerged from inside a 
wardrobe, covered with dust and cobwebs, his eyes vacant, his mind on some 
complicated matter known only to himself which absorbed him completely.
   Occasionally he climbed on a pelmet and froze into immobility, a counterpart to 
the large stuffed vulture which hung on the wall opposite. In this crouching pose, 
with misty eyes and a sly smile on his lips, he remained for long periods without 
moving, except to flap his arms like wings and crow like a cock whenever anybody 
entered the room.
   We ceased to pay attention to these oddities in which father became daily more 
and more involved. Almost completely ridden of bodily needs, not taking any 
nourishment for weeks, he plunged deeper every day into some strange and complex 
affairs which were beyond our understanding. To all our persuasions and our 
entreaties, he answered in fragments of his interior monologue which nothing from 
the outside could disturb. Constantly absorbed, morbidly excited, with flushes on 
his dry cheeks he did not notice us or even hear us any more.
   We became used to his harmless presence, to his soft babbling and that childlike 
self-absorbed twittering which sounded as if they came from the margin of our own 
time. During that period he used to disappear for many days into some distant 
corner of the house and it was difficult to locate him.
   Gradually these disappearances ceased to make any impression on us, we became 
used to them and when, after many days, father reappeared a few inches shorter and 
much thinner, we did not stop to think about it. We did not count him as one of us 
any more, so very remote had he become from everything that was human and real. 
Knot by knot, he loosened himself from us, point by point he gave up the ties 
joining him to the human community.
   What still remained of him-the small shroud of his body and the handful of 
nonsensical oddities-would finally disappear one day, as unremarked as the grey 
heap of rubbish swept into a corner, waiting to be taken by Adela to the rubbish 
dump. 


BIRDS

	CAME THE YELLOW DAYS of winter, filled with boredom. The rust-coloured earth 
was covered with a threadbare, meagre tablecloth of snow full of holes. There was 
not enough of it for some of the roofs and so they stood there, black and brown, 
shingle and thatch, arks containing the sooty expanses of attics-coal-black 
cathedrals, bristling with ribs of rafters, beams and spars-the dark lungs of 
winter winds. Each dawn revealed new chimney stacks and chimney pots which had 
emerged during the hours of darkness, blown up by the night winds: the black pipes 
of a Devil's organ. The chimney-sweeps could not get rid of the crows which in the 
evening covered the branches of the trees around the church with living black 
leaves, then took off, fluttering, and came back, each clinging to its own place on 
its own branch, only to fly away at dawn in large flocks, like gusts of soot, 
flakes of dirt, undulating and fantastic, blackening with their insistent crowing 
the musty-yellow streaks of light. The days hardened with cold and boredom like 
last year's loaves of bread. One began to cut them with blunt knives without 
appetite, with a lazy indifference.    Father had stopped going out. He banked up 
the stoves, studied the ever elusive essence of fire, experienced the salty, 
metallic taste and the smoky smell of wintry flames, the cool caresses of 
salamanders that licked the shiny soot in the throat of the chimney. He applied 
himself lovingly at that time to all manner of small repairs in the upper regions 
of the rooms. At all hours of the day one could see him crouched on top of a 
ladder, working at something under the ceiling, at the cornices over the tall 
windows, at the counter-weights and chains of the hanging lamps. Following the 
custom of house painters, he used a pair of steps as enormous stilts and he felt 
perfectly happy in that bird's eye perspective close to the sky, leaves and birds 
painted on the ceiling. He grew more and more remote from practical affairs. When 
my mother, worried and unhappy about his condition, tried to draw him into a 
conversation about business, about the payments due at the end of the month, he 
listened to her absentmindedly, anxiety showing in his abstracted look. Sometimes 
he stopped her with a warning gesture of the hand in order to run to a corner of 
the room, put his ear to a crack in the floor and, by lifting the index finger of 
both hands, emphasise the gravity of the investigation, and begin to listen 
intently. At that time we did not yet understand the sad origin of these 
eccentricities, the deplorable complex which had been maturing in him.
   Mother had no influence over him, but he gave a lot of respectful attention to 
Adela. The cleaning of his room was to him a great and important ceremony, of which 
he always arranged to be a witness, watching all Adela's movements with a mixture 
of apprehension and pleasurable excitement. He ascribed to all her functions a 
deeper, symbolic meaning. When, with young firm gestures, the girl pushed a long-
handled broom along the floor, father could hardly bear it. Tears would stream from 
his eyes, silent laughter transformed his face and his body was shaken by spasms of 
delight. He was ticklish to the point of madness. It was enough for Adela to waggle 
her fingers at him to imitate tickling, for him to rush through all the rooms in a 
wild panic, banging the doors after him, to fall at last flat on the bed in the 
furthest room and wriggle in convulsions of laughter, imagining the tickling which 
he found irresistible. Because of this, Adela's power over father was almost 
limitless.
   At that time we noticed for the first time father's passionate interest in 
animals. To begin with, it was the passion of the huntsman and the artist rolled 
into one. It was almost perhaps a deeper, biological sympathy of one creature for 
kindred, yet different forms of life, a kind of experimenting in the unexplored 
regions of existence. Only at a later stage did matters take that uncanny, 
complicated, essentially sinful and unnatural turn, which it is better not to bring 
into the light of day. But it all began with the hatching out of birds' eggs.
   With a great outlay of effort and money, father imported from Hamburg, or 
Holland, or from zoological stations in Africa, birds' eggs on which he set 
enormous broody hens from Belgium. It was a process which fascinated me as well-
this hatching out of the chicks, which were real anomalies of shape and colour. It 
was difficult to anticipate in these monsters with enormous, fantastic beaks which 
they opened wide immediately after birth, hissing greedily to show the backs of 
their throats, in these lizards with frail, naked bodies of hunchbacks, the future 
peacocks, pheasants, grouse or condors. Placed in cottonwool, in baskets, this 
dragon brood lifted blind, wall-eyed heads on thin necks, croaking voicelessly from 
their dumb throats. My father would walk along the shelves, dressed in a green 
baize apron like a gardener in a hothouse of cacti, and conjure up from nothingness 
these blind bubbles, pulsating with life, these impotent bellies receiving the 
outside world only in the form of food, these growths on the surface of life, 
climbing blindfold towards the light. A few weeks' later when these blind buds of 
matter burst open, the rooms were filled with the bright chatter and scintillating 
chirruping of its new inhabitants. The birds perched on the curtain pelmets, on the 
tops of wardrobes; they nestled in the tangle of tin branches and the metal scrolls 
of the hanging lamps.
   While father pored over his large ornithological textbooks and studied their 
coloured plates, these feathery phantasms seemed to rise from the pages and fill 
the rooms with colours, with splashes of crimson, strips of sapphire, verdigris and 
silver. At feeding time they formed a motley, undulating bed on the floor, a living 
carpet which at the intrusion of a stranger would fall apart, scatter into 
fragments, flutter in the air, and finally settle high under the ceilings. I 
remember in particular a certain condor, an enormous bird with a featherless neck, 
its face wrinkled and knobbly. It was an emaciated ascetic, a Buddhist lama, full 
of imperturbable dignity in its behaviour, guided by the rigid ceremonial of its 
great species. When it sat facing my father, motionless in the monumental position 
of ageless Egyptian idols, its eye covered with a whitish cataract which it pulled 
down sideways over its pupil to shut itself up completely in the contemplation of 
its dignified solitude-it seemed, with its stony profile, like an older brother of 
my father's. Its body and muscles seemed to be made of the same material, it had 
the same hard, wrinkled skin, the same desiccated bony face, the same horny deep 
eye sockets. Even the hands, strong in the joints, my father's long thick hands 
with their rounded nails, had their counterpart in the condor's claws. I could not 
resist the impression, when looking at the sleeping condor, that I was in the 
presence of a mummy-a dried out, shrunken mummy of my father. I believe that even 
my mother noticed this strange resemblance although we never discussed the subject. 
It is significant that the condor used my father's chamberpot.
   Not content with the hatching out of more and more new specimens, my father 
arranged the marriages of birds in the attic, he sent out matchmakers, he tied up 
eager attractive brides in the holes and crannies under the roof, and soon the roof 
of our house, an enormous double-ridged shingle roof, became a real birds' hostel, 
a Noah's ark to which all kinds of feathery creatures flew from far afield. Long 
after the liquidation of the birds' paradise, this tradition persisted in the avian 
world and during the period of spring migration our roof was besieged by whole 
flocks of cranes, pelicans, peacocks and sundry other birds. However, after a short 
period of splendour, the whole undertaking took a sorry turn.
   It soon became necessary to move my father to two rooms at the top of the house 
which had served as box rooms. We could hear from there, at dawn, the mixed 
clangour of birds' voices. The wooden walls of the attic rooms, helped by the 
resonance of the empty space under the gables, sounded with the roar, the 
flutterings, the crowing, the gurgling, the mating cries. For a few weeks father 
was lost to view. He only rarely came down to the flat and, when he did, we noticed 
that he seemed to have shrunk, to have become smaller and thinner. Occasionally 
forgetting himself, he would rise from his chair at table, wave his arms as if they 
were wings, and emit a long-drawn-out bird's call while his eyes misted over. Then, 
rather embarrassed, he would join us in laughing it off and try to turn the whole 
incident into a joke.
   One day, during spring cleaning, Adela suddenly appeared in father's birds' 
kingdom. Stopping in the doorway, she wrung her hands at the foetid smell that 
filled the room, the heaps of droppings covering the floor, the tables and the 
chairs. Without hesitation, she flung open a window and, with the help of a long 
broom, she prodded the whole mass of birds into life. A fiendish cloud of feathers 
and wings arose screaming and Adela, like a furious Maenad protected by the 
whirlwind of her thyrsus, danced the dance of destruction. My father, waving his 
arms in panic, tried to lift himself into the air with his feathered flock. Slowly 
the winged cloud thinned until at last Adela remained on the battlefield, exhausted 
and out of breath, along with my father who now, adopting a worried hang dog 
expression, was ready to accept complete defeat.
   A moment later, my father came downstairs-a broken man, an exiled king who had 
lost his throne and his kingdom.
   

TAILOR'S DUMMIES

	THE AFFAIR OF THE BIRDS was the last colourful and splendid counter-offensive 
of fantasy which my father, that incorrigible improviser, that fencing-master of 
imagination, had led against the trenches and defence-works of a sterile and empty 
winter. Only now do I understand the lonely heroism with which he alone had waged 
war against the fathomless elemental boredom that strangled the city. Without any 
support, without recognition on our part, that strangest of men was defending the 
lost cause of poetry. He was like a magic mill, into the hoppers of which the bran 
of empty hours was poured, to reemerge flowering in all the colours and scents of 
Oriental spices. But, used to the splendid showmanship of that metaphysical 
conjuror, we were climbed to underrate the value of his sovereign magic which saved 
us from the lethargy of empty days and nights.
   Adela was not rebuked for her thoughtless and brutal vandalism. On the contrary, 
we felt a vile satisfaction, a disgraceful pleasure that father's exuberance had 
been curbed, for although we had enjoyed it to the full, we later ignominiously 
denied all responsibility for it. Perhaps in our treachery there was secret 
approval of the victorious Adela to whom we dimly ascribed some commission and 
assignment from forces of a higher order. Betrayed by us all, father retreated 
without a fight from the scenes of his recent glory. Without crossing swords, he 
surrendered to the enemy the kingdom of his former splendour. A voluntary exile, he 
took himself off to an empty room at the end of the passage and there immured 
himself in solitude.
We forgot him.
   We were beset again from all sides by the mournful greyness of the city which 
crept through the windows with the dark rash of dawn, with
the mushroom growth of dusk, developing into the shaggy fur of long winter nights. 
The wallpaper of the rooms, blissfully unconstrained in those former days and 
accessible to the multicoloured flights of the birds, closed in on itself and 
hardened, becoming engrossed in the monotony of bitter monologues.
   The chandeliers blackened and wilted like old thistles; now they hung dejected 
and ill-tempered, their glass pendants ringing softly whenever anybody groped their 
way through the dimly lit room. In vain did Adela put coloured candles in all the 
holders; they were a poor substitute for, a pale reflection of, those splendid 
illuminations which had so recently enlivened these hanging gardens. Oh, what a 
twittering had been there, what swift and fantastic flights cutting the air into 
packs of magic cards, sprinkling thick flakes of azure, of peacock and parrot 
green, of metallic sparkle, drawing lines and flourishes in the air, displaying 
coloured fans which remained suspended, long after flight, in the shimmering 
atmosphere. Even now, in the depth of the greyness, echoes and memories of 
brightness were hidden but nobody caught them, no clarinet drilled the troubled 
air.
Those weeks passed under the sign of a strange drowsiness.
   Beds unmade for days on end, piled high with bedding crumpled and disordered 
from the weight of dreams, stood like deep boats waiting to sail into the dank and 
confusing labyrinths of some dark starless Venice. In the bleakness of dawn, Adela 
brought us coffee. Lazily we started dressing in the cold rooms, in the light of a 
single candle reflected many times in black window panes. The mornings were full of 
aimless bustle, of prolonged searches in endless drawers and cupboards. The 
clacking of Adela's slippers could be heard all over the flat. The shop assistants 
lit the lanterns, took the large shop keys which mother handed them and went out 
into the thick swirling darkness. Mother could not come to terms with her dressing. 
The candles burnt smaller in the candlesticks. Adela disappeared somewhere into the 
furthest rooms or into the attic where she hung the washing. She was deaf to our 
calling. A newly lit, dirty, bleak fire in
the stove licked at the cold, shiny growth of soot in the throat of the chimney. 
The candle died out, and the room filled with gloom. With our heads on the 
tablecloth, among the remains of breakfast, we fell asleep, still half-dressed. 
Lying face downward on the furry lap of darkness, we sailed in its regular 
breathing into the starless nothingness. We were awakened by Adela's noisy tidying 
up. Mother could not cope with her dressing. Before she had finished doing her 
hair, the shop-assistants were back for lunch. The halflight in the market place 
was now the colour of golden smoke. For a moment it looked as if out of that smoke-
coloured honey, that opaque amber, a most beautiful afternoon would unfold. But the 
happy moment passed, the amalgam of dawn withered, the swelling fermentation of the 
day, almost completed, receded again into a helpless greyness. We assembled again 
around the table, the shop assistants rubbed their hands, red from the cold, and 
the prose of their conversation suddenly revealed a fullgrown day, a grey and empty 
Tuesday, a day without tradition and without a face. But it was only when a dish 
appeared on the table containing two large fish in jelly lying side by side, head 
to tail, like a sign of the Zodiac, that we recognised in them the coat of arms of 
that day the calendar emblem of the nameless Tuesday: we shared it out quickly 
among ourselves, thankful that the day had at last achieved an identity.
   The shop assistants ate with unction, with the seriousness due to a calendar 
feast. The smell of pepper filled the room. And when they had used pieces of bread 
to wipe up the remains of the jelly from their plates, pondering in silence on the 
heraldry of the following days of the week, and nothing remained on the serving 
dish but the fishheads with their boiled out eyes, we all felt that by a communal 
effort we had conquered the day and that what remained of it did not matter.
   And, in fact, Adela made short work of the rest of the day, now surrendered to 
her mercies. Amidst the clatter of saucepans and splashing of cold water, she was 
energetically liquidating the few hours remaining until dusk, while mother slept on 
the sofa. Meanwhile, in
the dining room the scene was being set for the evening. Polda and Pauline, the 
sewing girls, spread themselves out there with the props of their trade. Carried on 
their shoulders, a silent immobile lady had entered the room, a lady of oakum and 
canvas, with a black wooden knob instead of a head. But when stood in the corner 
between the door and the stove, that silent woman became mistress of the situation. 
Standing motionless in her corner, she supervised the girls' advances and wooing as 
they knelt before her, fitting fragments of a dress marked with white tacking 
thread. They waited with attention and patience on the silent idol, which was 
difficult to please. That moloch was inexorable as only a female moloch can be, and 
sent them back to work again and again, and they, thin and spindly, like wooden 
spools from which thread is unwound and as mobile, manipulated with deft fingers 
the piles of silk and cloth, cut with noisy scissors into its colourful mass, 
whirred the sewing machine, treading its pedal with one cheap patent-leathered 
foot, while around them there grew a heap of cuttings, of motley rags and pieces 
like husks and chaff spat out by two fussy and prodigal parrots. The curved jaws of 
the scissors tapped open like the beaks of those exotic birds.
   The girls trod absentmindedly on the bright shreds of material, wading 
carelessly in the rubbish of a possible carnival, in the lumber room of some great, 
unrealized masquerade. They disentangled themselves with nervous giggles from the 
trimmings, their eyes laughed into the mirrors. Their hearts, the quick magic of 
their fingers, were not in the boring dresses which remained on the table, but in 
the thousand scraps, the frivolous and fickle trimmings, with the colourful 
fantastic snowstorm with which they could smother the whole city.
   Suddenly they felt hot and opened the window to see, in the frustration of their 
solitude, in their hunger for new faces, at least one nameless face pressed against 
the pane. They fanned their flushed cheeks with the winter night air in which the 
curtains billowed-they uncovered their burning decolletes, full of hatred and 
rivalry for one another, ready to fight for any Pierrot whom the dark breezes of 
night
might blow in through the window. Ah! how little did they demand from reality! They 
had everything within themselves, they had a surfeit of everything in themselves. 
Ah! they would be content with a sawdust Pierrot with the long-awaited word to act 
as the cue for their wellrehearsed roles, so that they could at last speak the 
lines, full of a sweet and terrible bitterness, that crowded to their lips exciting 
them violently like some novel devoured at night while the tears streamed down 
their cheeks.
   During one of his nightly wanderings about the flat, undertaken in Adela's 
absence, my father stumbled upon such a quiet evening sewing session. For a moment 
he stood in the dark door of the adjoining room, a lamp in his hand, enchanted by 
the scene of feverish activity, by the blushes-that synthesis of face-powder, red 
tissue-paper and atropine-to which the winter night, breathing on the waving window 
curtains acted as a significant backdrop. Putting on his glasses, he stepped 
quickly up to the girls and walked twice around them, letting fall on them the 
light of the lamp he was carrying. The draught from the open door lifted the 
curtains; the girls let themselves be admired, twisting their hips; the enamel of 
their eyes glinted like the shiny leather of their shoes and the buckles of their 
garters, showing from under their skirts lifted by the wind; the scraps began to 
scamper across the floor like rats towards the half-closed door of the dark room 
and my father gazed attentively at the panting girls, whispering softly: "Genus 
avium . . . If I am not mistaken, scansores or pistacci . . . very remarkable, very 
remarkable indeed."
   This accidental encounter was the beginning of a whole series of meetings, in 
the course of which my father succeeded in charming both of the young ladies with 
the magnetism of his strange personality. In return for his witty and elegant 
conversation, which filled the emptiness of their evenings, the girls permitted the 
ardent ornithologist to study the structure of their thin and ordinary little 
bodies. This took place while the conversation was in progress and was done with a 
seriousness and grace which ensured that even the more risky points
of these researches remained completely unequivocal. Pulling Pauline's stocking 
down from her knee and studying with enraptured eyes the precise and noble 
structure of the joint, my father would say:
   "How delightful and happy is the form of existence which you ladies have chosen. 
How beautiful and simple is the truth which is revealed by your lives. And with 
that mastery, with what precision you are performing your task. If, forgetting the 
respect due to the Creator, I were to attempt a criticism of creation, I would say 
'Less matter, more form!' Ah, what relief it would be for the world to lose some of 
its contents. More modesty in aspirations, more sobriety in claims, Gentlemen 
Demiurges, and the world would be more perfect!" my father exclaimed, which his 
hands released Pauline's white calf from the prison of her stocking.
   At that moment Adela appeared in the open door of the dining room, the supper 
tray in her hands. This was the first meeting of the two enemy powers since the 
great battle. All of us who witnessed it felt a moment of terrible fear. We felt 
extremely uneasy at being present at the further humiliation of the sorely tried 
man. My father rose from his knees very disturbed, blushing more and more deeply in 
wave after wave of shame. But Adela found herself unexpectedly equal to the 
situation. She walked up to father with a smile, and flipped him on the nose. At 
that, Polda and Pauline clapped their hands, stamped their feet and each grabbing 
one of father's arms, began to dance with him round the table. Thus, because of the 
girls? good nature, the cloud of unpleasantness dispersed in general hilarity.
   That was the beginning of a series of most interesting and most unusual lectures 
which my father, inspired by the charm of that small and innocent audience, 
delivered during the subsequent weeks of that early winter.
   It is worth noting how, in contact with that strange man, all things reverted, 
as it were, to the roots of their existence, rebuilt their outward appearance anew 
from their metaphysical core, returned to the primary idea, in order to betray it 
at some point and to turn into the doubtful,
risky and equivocal regions which we shall call for short the Regions of the Great 
Heresy. Our Heresiarch walked meanwhile like a mesmerist, infecting everything with 
his dangerous charm. Am I to call Pauline his victim? She became in those days his 
pupil and disciple, and at the same time a guinea-pig for his experiments.
   Next I shall attempt to explain, with due care and without causing offence, this 
most heretical doctrine which held father in its sway for many months to come and 
which during this time prompted all his actions.


TREATISE ON TAILORS' DUMMIES
or
THE SECOND BOOK OF GENESIS

	"The Demiurge," said my father, "has had no monopoly of creation, for 
creation is the privilege of all spirits. Matter has been given infinite fertility, 
inexhaustible vitality and, at the same time, a seductive power of temptation which 
invites us to create as well. In the depth of matter, indistinct smiles are shaped, 
tensions build up, attempts at form appear. The whole of matter pulsates with 
infinite possibilities which send dull shivers through it. Waiting for the life-
giving breath of the spirit, it is endlessly in motion. It entices us with a 
thousand sweet, soft, round shapes which it blindly dreams up within itself.
   "Deprived of all initiative, indulgently acquiescent, pliable like a woman, 
submissive to every impulse, it is a territory outside any law, open to all kinds 
of charlatans and dilettanti, a domain of abuses and of dubious demiurgical 
manipulations. Matter is the most passive and most defenceless essence in cosmos. 
Anyone can mould it and shape it; it obeys everybody. All attempts at organising 
matter are transient and temporary, easy to reverse and to dissolve. There is no 
evil in reducing life to other and newer forms. Homicide is not a sin. It is 
sometimes a necessary violence on resistant and ossified forms of existence which 
have ceased to be amusing. In the interests of an important and fascinating 
experiment, it can even become meritorious. Here is the starting point of a new 
apologia for sadism. "
   My father never tired of glorifying this extraordinary element- matter.
   "There is no dead matter," he taught us, "lifelessness is only a disguise behind 
which hide unknown forms of life. The range of these forms is infinite and their 
shades and nuances limitless. The Demiurge was in possession of important and 
interesting creative recipes. Thanks to them he created a multiplicity of species, 
which renew themselves by their own devices. No one knows whether these recipes 
will ever be reconstructed. But this is unnecessary, because even if the classical 
methods of creation should prove inaccessible for evermore, there still remain some 
illegal methods, an infinity of heretical and criminal methods. "
   As my father proceeded from these general principles of cosmogony to the more 
restricted sphere of his private interests, his voice sank to an impressive 
whisper, the lecture became ever more complicated and difficult to follow and the 
conclusions which he reached became more dubious and dangerous. His gestures 
acquired an esoteric solemnity. He half-closed one eye, put two fingers to his 
forehead while a look of extraordinary slyness came over his face. He transfixed 
his listeners with these looks, violated with his cynical expression their most 
intimate and most private reserve, until he had reached them in the furthest corner 
whither they had retreated, pressed them against the wall and tickled them with the 
finger of irony, finally producing a glimmer of understanding laughter, the 
laughter of agreement and admission, the visible sign of capitulation.
   The girls sat perfectly still, the lamp smoked, the piece of material under the 
needle of the sewing machine had long since slipped to the floor, and the machine 
ran empty, stitching only the black, starless cloth unwinding from the bale of 
winter darkness outside the window.
   "We have lived for too long under the terror of the matchless perfection of the 
Demiurge," my father said. "For too long the perfec tion of his creation has 
paralysed our own creative instinct. We don't wish to compete with him. We have no 
ambition to emulate him. We wish to be creators in our own, lower sphere; we want 
to have the privilege of creation, we want creative delights, we want- in one word-
Demiurgy. " I don't know on whose behalf my father was proclaiming these demands, 
what community or corporation, sect or order supported him loyally and lent the 
necessary weight to his words. As for us, we did not share these demiurgical 
aspirations.
   But father had meanwhile developed the programme of this second Demiurgy, the 
picture of the second Genesis of creatures which was to stand in open opposition to 
the present era.
   "We are not concerned," he said, "with long-winded creations, with long-term 
beings. Our creatures will not be heroes of romances in many volumes. Their roles 
will be short, concise; their characters- without a background. Sometimes for one 
gesture, for one word alone, we shall make the effort to bring them to life. We 
openly admit: we shall not insist either on durability or solidity of workmanship; 
our creations will be temporary, to serve for a single occasion. If they be human 
beings, we shall give them, for example, only one profile, one hand, one leg, the 
one limb needed for their role. It would be pedantic to bother about the other, 
unnecessary, leg. Their backs can be made of canvas or simply whitewashed. We shall 
have this proud slogan as our aim: a different actor for every gesture. For each 
action, each word, we shall call to life a different human being. Such is our whim, 
and the world will be run according to our pleasure. Demiurge was in love with 
consummate, superb and complicated materials; we shall give priority to trash. We 
are simply entranced and enchanted by the cheapness, shabbiness and inferiority of 
material."
   "Can you understand," asked my father, "the deep meaning of that weakness, that 
passion for coloured tissue, for papier mache, for distemper, for oakum and 
sawdust? This is," he continued with a pained smile, "the proof of our love for 
matter as such, for its fluffiness or porosity, for its unique mystical 
consistency. Demiurge, that great
master and artist, made matter invisible, made it disappear under the surface of 
life. We, on the contrary, love its creaking, its resistance, its clumsiness. We 
like to see behind each gesture, behind each move, its inertia, its heavy effort, 
its bear-like awkwardness."
   The girls sat motionless, with glazed eyes. Their faces were long and stultified 
by listening, their cheeks flushed, and it would have been difficult to decide at 
that moment whether they belonged to the first or the second Genesis of Creation.
   "In one word," father concluded, "we wish to create man a second time, in the 
shape and semblance of a tailor's dummy."
   Here, for reasons of accuracy, we must describe an insignificant small incident 
which occurred at that point of the lecture and to which we do not attach much 
importance. The incident, completely nonsensical and incomprehensible in the 
sequence of events, could probably be explained as vestigial automatism, without 
cause and effect, as an instance of the malice of inanimate objects transferred 
into the region of psychology. We advise the reader to treat it as lightly as we 
are doing. Here is what happened.
   Just as my father pronounced the word "dummy," Adela looked at her wristwatch 
and exchanged a knowing look with Polda. She then moved her chair forward and, 
without getting up from it, lifted her dress to reveal her foot tightly covered in 
black silk, and then stretched it out stiffly like a serpent's head.
   She sat thus throughout that scene, upright, her large eyes, shining from 
atropine, fluttering, while Polda and Pauline sat at her sides. All three looked at 
father with wide open eyes. My father coughed nervously, fell silent and suddenly 
became very red in the face. Within a minute the lines of his face, so expressive 
and vibrant a moment before, became still and his expression became humble.
   He-the inspired heresiarch, just emerging from the clouds of exaltation-suddenly 
collapsed and folded up. Or perhaps he had been exchanged for another man? That 
other man now sat stiffly, very flushed, with downcast eyes. Polda went up to him 
and bent over him. Patting him lightly on the back, she spoke in the tone of gentle 
encouragement: "Jacob must be sensible. Jacob must obey, Jacob must not be 
obstinate. Please, Jacob . . . Please . . ."
   Adela's outstretched slipper trembled slightly and shone like a serpent's 
tongue. My father rose slowly, still looking down, took a step forward like an 
automaton, and fell to his knees. The lamp hissed in the silence of the room, 
eloquent looks ran up and down in the thicket of wallpaper patterns, whispers of 
venomous tongues floated in the air, zigzags of thought...


TREATISE ON TAILORS' DUMMIES
CONTINUATION

	The next evening father reverted with renewed enthusiasm to his dark and 
complex subject. Each wrinkle of his deeply lined face expressed incredible 
cunning. In each fold of skin, a missile of irony lay hidden. But occasionally 
inspiration widened the spirals of his wrinkles and they swelled horribly and sank 
in silent whorls into the depths of the winter night.

   "Figures in a wax-work museum," he began, "even fair-ground parodies of dummies, 
must not be treated lightly. Matter never makes jokes: it is always full of the 
tragically serious. Who dares to think that you can play with matter, that you can 
shape it for a joke, that the joke will not be built in, will not eat into it like 
fate, like destiny? Can you imagine the pain, the dull imprisoned suffering, hewn 
into the matter of that dummy which does not know why it must be what it is, why it 
must remain in that forcibly imposed form which is no more than a parody? Do you 
understand the power of form, of expression, of pretense, the arbitrary tyranny 
imposed on a helpless block, and ruling it like its own, tyrannical, despotic soul? 
You give a head of canvas and oakum an expression of anger and leave it with it, 
with the convulsion, the tension enclosed once and for all, with a blind fury for 
which there is no outlet. The crowd laughs at the parody. Weep, ladies,over your 
own fate, when you see the misery of imprisoned matter, of tortured matter which 
does not know what it is and why it is, nor where the gesture may lead that has 
been imposed on it for ever.

   "The crowd laughs. Do you understand the terrible sadism, the exhilarating, 
demiurgical cruelty of that laughter? Yet we should weep, ladies, at our own fate, 
when we see that misery of violated matter, against which a terrible wrong has been 
committed. Hence the frightening sadness of all those jesting Golems, of all 
effigies which brood tragically over their comic grimaces.

   "Look at the anarchist Luccheni, the murderer of the Empress Elizabeth of 
Austria; look at Draga, the diabolical and unhappy Queen of Serbia, look at that 
youth of genius, the hope and pride of his ancient family, ruined by the 
unfortunate habit of masturbation. Oh, the irony of those names, of those 
pretensions!

   "Is there anything left of Queen Draga in the wax-figure likeness, any 
similarity, even the most remote shadow of her being? But the resemblance, the 
pretence, the name reassures us and stops us from asking what that unfortunate 
figure is in itself and by itself. And yet it must be somebody, somebody anonymous, 
menacing and unhappy, some being that in its dumb existence had never heard of 
Queen Draga....

   "Have you heard at night the terrible howling of these wax figures, shut in 
their fair-booths; the pitiful chorus of those forms of wood or porcelain, banging 
their fists against the walls of their prisons?"

   In my father's face, convulsed by the horror of the visions which he had 
conjured up from darkness, a spiral of wrinkles appeared, a maelstrom growing 
deeper and deeper, at the bottom of which there flared the terrible eye of a 
prophet. His beard bristled grotesquely, the tufts of hair growing from warts and 
moles and from his nostrils stood on end. He became rigid and stood with flaming 
eyes, trembling from an internal conflict like an automaton of which the mechanism 
has broken down.

	Adela rose from her chair and asked us to avert our eyes from
what was to follow. Then she went up to father and, with her hands on his hips in a 
pose of great determination, she spoke very clearly.

   The two other girls sat stiffly, with downcast eyes, strangely numb . . .


TREATISE ON TAILORS' DUMMIES
CONCLUSION

	On one of the following evenings, my father continued his lecture thus: "When 
I announced my talk about lay figures, I had not really wanted to speak about those 
incarnate misunderstandings, those sad parodies that are the fruits of a common and 
vulgar lack of restraint. I had something else in mind."

   Here my father began to set before our eyes the picture of that generatio 
aequivoca which he had dreamed up, a species of beings only half organic, a kind of 
pseudo-fauna and pseudo-flora, the result of a fantastic fermentation of matter.

   They were creations resembling, in appearance only, living creatures such as 
crustaceans, vertebrates, cephalopods. In reality the appearance was misleading-
they were amorphous creatures, with no internal structure, products of the 
imitative tendency of matter which, equipped with memory, repeats from force of 
habit the forms already accepted. The morphological scope of matter is limited on 
the whole and a certain quota of forms is repeated over and over again on various 
levels of existence.

   These creatures-mobile, sensitive to stimuli and yet outside the pale of real 
life-could be brought forth by suspending certain complex colloids in solutions of 
kitchen salt. These colloids, after a number of days, would form and organise 
themselves in precipitations of substance resembling lower forms of fauna.

   In creatures conceived in this way, one could observe the processes of 
respiration and metabolism, but chemical analysis revealed in them neither traces 
of albumen nor of carbon compounds.
   Yet these primitive forms were unremarkable compared with the richness of shapes 
and the splendour of the pseudo-fauna and the pseudo-flora, which sometimes 
appeared in certain strictly defined environments, such as old apartments saturated 
with the emanations of numerous existences and events; used up atmospheres rich in 
the specific ingredients of human dreams; rubbish heaps, abounding in the humus of 
memories, of nostalgia and of sterile boredom. On such a soil, this pseudo-
vegetation sprouted abundantly yet ephemerally, brought forth short-lived 
generations which flourished suddenly and splendidly, only to wilt and perish.

   In apartments of that kind, wallpapers must be very weary and bored with the 
incessant changes in all the cadenzas of rhythm; no wonder that they are 
susceptible to distant, dangerous dreams. The essence of furniture is unstable, 
degenerate and receptive to abnormal temptations: it is then that on this sick, 
tired and wasted soil colourful and exuberant mildew can flourish in a fantastic 
growth, like a beautiful rash.

   "As you will no doubt know," said my father, "in old apartments there are rooms 
which are sometimes forgotten. Unvisited for months on end, they wilt neglected 
between the old walls and it happens that they close in on themselves, become 
overgrown with bricks and, lost once and for all to our memory, forfeit their only 
claim to existence. The doors, leading to them from some backstairs landing, have 
been overlooked by people living in the flat for so long that they merge with the 
wall, grow into it, and all trace of them is obliterated in a complicated design of 
lines and cracks.

   "Once early in the morning towards the end of winter," my father continued, 
"after many months of absence, I entered such a forgotten passage, and I was amazed 
at the appearance of the rooms.

   "From all the crevices in the floor, from all the mouldings, from every recess, 
there grew slim shoots filling the grey air with a scintillating filigree lace of 
leaves: a hot-house jungle, full of whispers and flicking lights-a false and 
blissful spring. Around the bed, under the lamp, along the wardrobes, grew clumps 
of delicate trees which, high above, spread their luminous crowns and fountains of 
lacy leaves, spraying cholorphyl, and thrusting up to the painted heaven of the 
ceiling. In the rapid process of blossoming, enormous white and pink flowers opened 
among the leaves, bursting from bud under your very eyes, displaying their pink 
pulp and spilling over to shed their petals and fall apart in quick decay.

   "I was happy," said my father, "to see that unexpected flowering which filled 
the air with a soft rustle, a gentle murmur, falling like coloured confetti through 
the thin rods of the twigs.

   "I could see the trembling of the air, the fermentation of too rich an 
atmosphere which provoked that precocious blossoming, luxuriation and wilting of 
the fantastic oleanders which had filled the room with a rare, lazy snowstorm of 
large pink clusters of flowers.

   "Before nightfall," concluded my father, "there was no trace left of that 
splendid flowering. The whole elusive sight was a Data Morgana, an example of the 
strange make-believe of matter which had created a semblance of life."

   My father was strangely animated that day; the expression in his eyes-a sly, 
ironic expression-was vivid and humorous. Later he suddenly became more serious and 
again analysed the infinite diversity of forms which the multifarious matter could 
adopt. He was fascinated by doubtful and problematic forms, like the ectoplasm of a 
medium, by pseudo-matter, the cataleptic emanations of the brain which in some 
instances spread from the mouth of the person in a trance over the whole table, 
filled the whole room, a floating, rarefied tissue, an astral dough, on the 
borderline between body and soul.

   "Who knows," he said, "how many suffering, crippled, fragmentary forms of life 
there are, such as the artificially created life of chests and tables quickly 
nailed together, crucified timbers, silent martyrs to cruel human inventiveness. 
The terrible transplantation of incompatible and hostile races of wood, their 
merging into one misbegotten personality.

   "How much ancient suffering is there in the varnished grain, in the veins and 
knots of our old familiar wardrobes? Who would recognise in them the old features, 
smiles and glances, almost planed and polished out of all recognition?"

   My father's face, when he said that, dissolved into a thoughtful net of 
wrinkles, began to resemble an old plank full of knots and veins, from which all 
memories had been planed away. For a moment we thought that father would fall into 
a state of apathy which sometimes took hold of him, but all of a sudden he 
recovered himself and continued to speak:

   "Ancient, mythical tribes used to embalm their dead. The walls of their houses 
were filled with bodies and heads immured in them: a father would stand in a corner 
of the drawing room- stuffed, the tanned skin of a deceased wife would serve as a 
mat under the table. I knew a certain sea captain who had in his cabin a lamp, made 
by Malayan embalmers from the body of his murdered mistress. On her head, she wore 
enormous antlers. In the stillness of the cabin, the face stretched between the 
antlers at the ceiling, slowly lifted its eyelids: on the half-opened lips a bubble 
of saliva would glint, then burst with the softest of whispers. Octopuses, 
tortoises, and enormous crabs, hanging from the rafters in place of chandeliers, 
moved their legs endlessly in that stillness, walking, walking, walking without 
moving .

   My father's face suddenly assumed a worried, sad expression when his thoughts, 
stirred by who knows what associations, prompted him to new examples:

   "Am I to conceal from you," he said in a low tone, "that my own brother, as a 
result of a long and incurable illness, has been gradually transformed into a 
bundle of rubber tubing, and that my poor cousin had to carry him day and night on 
his cushion, singing to the luckless creature endless lullabies on winter nights? 
Can there by anything sadder than a human being changed into the rubber tube of an 
enema? What disappointment for his parents, what confusion for their feelings,
what frustration of the hopes centered round the promising youth! And yet, the 
faithful love of my poor cousin was not denied him even during that 
transformation."

   "Oh, please, I cannot, I really cannot listen to this any longer!" groaned Polda 
leaning over her chair. "Make him stop, Adela . . ."

   The girls got up, Adela went up to my father with an outstretched finger made as 
if to tickle him. Father lost countenance, immediately stopped talking and, very 
frightened, began to back away from Adela's moving finger. She followed him, 
however, threatening him with her finger, driving him, step by step, out of the 
room. Pauline yawned and stretched herself. She and Polda, leaning against one 
another, exchanged a look and a smile.
   
   
CINNAMON SHOPS

	AT THE TIME of the shortest, sleepy winter days, edged on both sides with the 
furry dusk of mornings and evenings, when the city reached out ever deeper into the 
labyrinth of winter nights, and was shaken reluctantly into consciousness by the 
short dawn, my father was already lost, sold and surrendered to the other sphere.
   His face and head became overgrown with a wild and recalcitrant shock of grey 
hair, bristling in irregular tufts and spikes, shooting out from warts, from his 
eyebrows, from the openings of his nostrils and giving him the appearance of an old 
ill-tempered fox.
   His sense of smell and his hearing sharpened extraordinarily and one could see 
from the expression of his tense silent face that through the intermediary of these 
two senses he remained in permanent contact with the unseen world of mouseholes, 
dark corners, chimney vents and dusty spaces under the floor.
   He was a vigilant and attentive observer, a prying fellow-conspirator, of the 
rustlings, the nightly creakings, the secret gnawing life of the floor. He was so 
engrossed in it that he became completely submerged in an inaccessible sphere and 
one which he did not even attempt to discuss with us.
   He often used to flip his fingers and laugh softly to himself when the 
manifestations of the unseen became too absurd; he then exchanged knowing looks 
with our cat which, also initiated in these mysteries, would lift its cynical cold 
striped face, closing the slanting chinks of its eyes with an air of indifference 
and boredom.
   It sometimes happened that, during a meal, my father would suddenly put aside 
his knife and fork and, with his napkin still tied around his neck, would rise from 
the table with a feline movement, tiptoe to the door of the adjoining room and peer 
through the key-hole with the utmost caution. Then, with a bashful smile, he would 
return to the table slightly embarrassed, murmuring and whispering indistinctly in 
tune with the interior monologue that wholly preoccupied him.
   To provide some distraction for him and to tear him away from these morbid 
speculations, my mother would force him to go out for a walk in the evenings. He 
went in silence, without protest but also without enthusiasm, distrait and absent 
in spirit. Once we even went all together to the theatre.
   We found ourselves again in that large, badly lit, dirty hall, full of somnolent 
human chatter and aimless confusion. But when we had made our way through the 
crowd, there emerged before us an enormous pale blue curtain, like the sky of 
another firmament. Large, painted pink masks, with puffed up cheeks floated in a 
huge expanse of canvas. The artificial sky spread out in both directions, swelling 
with the powerful breath of pathos and of great gestures, with the atmosphere of 
that fictitious floodlit world created on the echoing scaffoldings of the stage. 
The tremor sailing across the large area of that sky, the breath of the vast canvas 
which made the masks revive and grow, revealed the illusory character of that 
firmament, caused that vibration of reality which, in metaphysical moments, we 
experience as the glimmer of revelation.
   The masks fluttered their red eyelids, their coloured lips whispered voicelessly 
and I knew that the moment was imminent when the tension of mystery would reach its 
zenith and the swollen skies of the curtain would really burst open to reveal 
incredible and dazzling events.
   But I was not allowed to experience that moment, because in the meantime my 
father had begun to betray a certain anxiety. He was feeling in all his pockets and 
at last declared that he had left behind at home a wallet containing money and 
certain most important documents.
   After a short conference with my mother, during which Adela's honesty was 
submitted to a hasty assessment, it was suggested that I should go home to look for 
the wallet. According to my mother, there was still plenty of time before the 
curtain rose and, fleet-footed as I was, I had every chance of returning in time. I 
stepped into a winter night bright from the illuminations of the sky. It was one of 
those clear nights when the starry firmament is so wide and spreads so far that it 
seems to be divided and broken up into a mass of separate skies, sufficient for a 
whole month of winter nights and providing silver and painted globes to cover all 
the nightly phenomena, adventures, occurrences and carnivals.
   It is exceedingly thoughtless to send a young boy out on an urgent and important 
errand into a night like that because in its semiobscurity the streets multiply, 
becoming confused and interchanged. There open up, deep inside a city, reflected 
streets, streets which are doubles, make-believe streets. One's imagination, 
bewitched and misled, creates illusory maps of the apparently familiar districts, 
maps in which the streets have their proper places and usual names but are provided 
with new and fictitious configurations by the inexhaustible inventiveness of the 
night. The temptations of such winter nights begin usually with the innocent desire 
to take a shortcut, to use a quicker but less familiar way. Attractive 
possibilities arise of shortening a complicated walk by taking some never used side 
street. But on that occasion things began differently.
   Having taken a few steps, I realised that I was not wearing my overcoat. I 
wanted to turn back, but after a moment that seemed to me an unnecessary waste of 
time, especially as the night was not cold at all; on the contrary, I could feel 
waves of an unseasonal warmth, like breezes of a spring night. The snow shrank into 
a white fluff, into a harmless fleece smelling sweetly of violets. Similar white 
fluffs were sailing across the sky on which the moon was doubled and trebled, 
showing all its phases and positions at once.
   On that night the sky laid bare its internal construction in many sections 
which, like quasi-anatomical exhibits showed the spirals and whorls of light, the 
pale green solids of darkness, the plasma of space, the tissue of dreams.
   On such a night, it was impossible to walk along Rampart Street or any other of 
the dark streets which are the obverse, the lining as it were, of the four sides of 
Market Square, and not to remember that at that late hour the strange and most 
attractive shops were sometimes open, the shops which on ordinary days one tended 
to overlook. I used to call them cinnamon shops because of the dark panelling of 
their walls.
   These truly noble shops, open late at night, have always been the objects of my 
ardent interest. Dimly lit, their dark and solemn interiors were redolent of the 
smell of paint, varnish and incense; of the aroma of distant countries and rare 
commodities. You could find in them Bengal lights, magic boxes, the stamps of long 
forgotten countries, Chinese transfers, indigo, calaphony from Malabar, the eggs of 
exotic insects, parrots, toucans, live salamanders and basilisks, mandrake roots, 
mechanical toys from Nuremberg, homunculi in jars, microscopes, binoculars and most 
especially strange and rare books, old folio volumes full of astonishing engravings 
and amazing stories.
   I remember those old dignified merchants who served their customers with 
downcast eyes, in discreet silence, and who were full of wisdom and tolerance for 
their customers' most secret whims. But most of all, I remember a bookshop in which 
I once glanced at some rare and forbidden pamphlets, the publications of secret 
societies lifting the veil on tantalizing and unknown mysteries.
   I so rarely had the occasion to visit these shops-especially with a small but 
sufficient amount of money in my pocket-that I could not forgo the opportunity I 
had now, in spite of the important mission entrusted to me.
   According to my calculations I ought to turn into a narrow lane and pass two or three side streets in order to reach the street of the night shops. This would take 
me even further from home, but by cutting across Saltworks Street, I could make 
good the delay.
   Lent wings by my desire to visit the cinnamon shops, I turned into a street I 
knew and ran rather than walked, anxious not to lose my way. I passed three or four 
streets, but still there was no sign of the turning I wanted. What is more, the 
appearance of the street was different from what I had expected. Nor was there any 
sign of the shops. I was in a street of houses with no doors and of which the 
tightly shut windows were blind from reflected moonlight. On the other side of 
those houses-I thought-must run the street from which they were accessible. I was 
walking faster now, rather disturbed, beginning to give up the idea of visiting the 
cinnamon shops. All I wanted now was to get out of there quickly into some part of 
the city I knew better. I reached the end of the street, unsure where it would lead 
me. I found myself in a broad, sparsely built avenue, very long and straight. I 
felt on me the breath of a wide open space. Close to the pavement or in the midst 
of their gardens, picturesque villas stood there, the private houses of the rich. 
In the gaps between them were parks and walls of orchards. The whole area looked 
like Lesznianska Street in its lower and rarely visited part. The moonlight 
filtered through a thousand feathery clouds like silver scales on the sky. It was 
pale and bright as daylight-only the parks and gardens stood black in that silvery 
landscape.
   Looking more closely at one of the buildings, I realised that what I saw was the 
back of the high school which I had never seen from that side. I was just 
approaching the gate which, to my surprise, was open; the entrance hall was lit. I 
walked in and found myself on the red carpet of the passage. I hoped to be able to 
slip through unobserved and come out through the front gate, thus taking a splendid 
shortcut.
   I remembered that at that late hour there might be, in Professor Arendt's 
classroom, one of the voluntary classes which in winter were always held in the 
late evenings and to which we all flocked, fired by the enthusiasm for art which 
that excellent teacher had awakened in us.
   A small group of industrious pupils was almost lost in the large dark hall on 
whose walls the enormous shadows of our heads broke abruptly, thrown by the light 
of two small candles set in bottles.
   To be truthful, we did not draw very much during these classes and the Professor 
was not very exacting. Some boys brought cushions from home and stretched 
themselves out on forms for a short nap. Only the most diligent of us gathered 
around the candle, in the golden circle of its light.
   We usually had to wait a long while for the Professor's arrival, filling the 
time with sleepy conversation. At last the door from his room would open and he 
would enter-short, bearded, given to esoteric smiles and discreet silences and 
exuding an aroma of secrecy. He shut the door of his study carefully behind him: 
through it for a brief moment we could see over his head a crowd of plaster 
shadows, the classical fragments of suffering Niobides, Danaids and Tantalides, the 
whole sad and sterile Olympus, wilting for years on end in that plaster-cast 
museum. The light in his room was opaque even in daytime, thick from the dreams of 
plaster-cast heads, from empty looks, ashen profiles and meditations dissolving 
into nothingness. We liked to listen sometimes in front of that door-listen to the 
silence laden with the sighs and whispers of the crumbling gods withering in the 
boredom and monotony of their twilight.
   The Professor walked with great dignity and unction up and down among the half-
empty forms in which, in small groups, we were drawing amidst the grey reflections 
of a winter night. Everything was quiet and cosy. Some of my class-mates were 
asleep. The candles were burning low in their bottles. The Professor delved into a 
deep bookcase, full of old folios, unfashionable engravings, woodcuts and prints. 
He showed us, with his esoteric gestures, old lithographs of night landscapes, of 
tree clumps in moonlight, of avenues in wintry parks outlined black on the white 
moonlit background.
   Amidst sleepy talk, time passed unnoticed. It ran by unevenly, as if making 
knots in the passage of hours, swallowing somewhere whole empty periods. Without 
transition, our whole gang found ourselves on the way home long after midnight on 
the garden path white with snow, flanked by the black, dry thicket of bushes. We 
walked alongside that hairy rim of darkness, brushing against the furry bushes, 
their lower branches snapping under our feet in the bright night, in a false milky 
brightness. The diffuse whiteness of light filtered by the snow, by the pale air, 
by the milky space, was like the grey paper of an engraving on which the thick 
bushes corresponded to the deep black lines of decoration. The night was copying 
now, at that late hour, the nightly landscapes of Professor Arendt's engravings, 
re-enacting his fantasies.
   In the black thickets of the park, in the hairy coat of bushes, in the mass of 
crusty twigs there were nooks, niches, nests of deepest fluffy blackness, full of 
confusion, secret gestures, conniving looks. It was warm and quiet there. We sat on 
the soft snow in our heavy coats, cracking hazel nuts of which there was a 
profusion in that spring-like winter. Through the copse, weasels wandered silently, 
martens and ichneumons, furry, ferreting elongated animals on short legs, stinking 
of sheepskin. We suspected that among them were the exhibits from the school 
cabinets which, although degutted and moulting, felt on that white night in their 
empty bowels the voice of the eternal instinct, the mating urge, and returned to 
the thickets for short moments of illusory life.
   But slowly the phosphorescence of the spring-like snow became dulled: it 
vanished then, giving way to a thick black darkness preceding dawn. Some of us fell 
asleep in the warm snow, others went groping in the dark for the doors of their 
houses and walked blindly into the sleep of their parents and brothers, into a 
continuation of deep snoring which caught up with them on their late return.
   These nightly drawing sessions held a secret charm for me, so that now I could 
nest forgo the opportunity of looking for a moment into the art room. I decided 
however that I would not stop for more than a little while. But walking up the back 
stairs, their cedar wood resounding under my steps, I realised that I was in a wing 
of the school building completely unknown to me. Not even a murmur interrupted the 
solemn silence. The passages were broader in this wing, covered with a thick carpet 
and most elegant. Small, darkly glowing lamps were hung at each corner. Turning the 
first of these, I found myself in an even wider, more sumptuous hall. In one of its 
walls there was a wide glass arcade leading to the interior of an apartment. I 
could see a long enfilade of rooms, furnished with great magnificence. The eye 
wandered over silk hangings, gilded mirrors, costly furniture and crystal 
chandeliers and into the velvety softness of the luxurious interiors, shimmering 
with lights, entangled garlands and budding flowers. The profound stillness of 
these empty rooms was filled with the secret glances exchanged by mirrors and the 
panic of friezes running high along the walls and disappearing into the stucco of 
the white ceilings.
   I faced all that magnificence with admiration and awe, guessing that my nightly 
escapade had brought me unexpectedly into the Headmaster's wing, to his private 
apartment. I stood there with a beating heart, rooted to the spot by curiosity, 
ready to escape at the slightest noise. How would I justify, if surprised, that 
nocturnal visit, that impudent prying? In one of those deep plush armchairs there 
might sit, unobserved and still, the young daughter of the Headmaster. She might 
lift her eyes to mine black, Sybilline, quiet eyes, the gaze of which none could 
hold. But to retreat half-way, not having carried through the plan I had, would be 
cowardly. Besides, deep silence reigned in those magnificent interiors, lit by the 
hazy light of an undefined hour. Through the arcades of the passage, I saw on the 
far side of the drawing room a large glass door leading to the terrace. It was so 
still everywhere that I felt suddenly emboldened. It did not strike me as too risky 
to walk down the short steps leading to the level of the drawing room, to take a 
few quick steps across the large costly carpet and to find myself on the terrace 
from which I could get back without any difficulty to the familiar street.
   This is what I did. When I found myself on the parquet floor under the potted 
palms that reached up to the frieze of the ceiling. I noticed that now I really was 
on neutral ground, because the drawing room did not have a front wall. It was a 
kind of large loggia, connected by a few steps with a city square, an enclosed part 
of the square, because some of the garden furniture stood directly on the pavement. 
I ran down the short flight of stone steps and found myself at street level once 
more.
   The constellations in the sky stood steeply on their heads, all the stars had 
made an about turn, but the moon, buried under the featherbed of clouds which were 
lit by its unseen presence, seemed still to have before her an endless journey and, 
absorbed in her complicated heavenly procedures, did not think of dawn.
   A few horse-drawn cabs loomed black in the street, half-broken and loose-jointed 
like crippled, dozing crabs or cockroaches. A driver leaned down towards me from 
his high box. He had a small, red, kindly face, "Shall we go, master?" he asked. 
The cab shook in all the joints and ligatures of its many-limbed body and made a 
start on its light wheels.
   But who would entrust oneself on such a night to the whims of an unpredictable 
cabby? Amidst the click of the axles, amidst the thud of the box and the roof, I 
could not agree with him on my destination. He nodded indulgently at everything I 
said and sang to himself. We drove in a circle around the city.
   In front of an inn stood a group of cabbies who waved friendly hands to him. He 
answered gaily and then, without stopping the carriage, he threw the reins on my 
knees, jumped down from the box and joined the group of his colleagues. The horse, 
an old, wise cab-horse, looked round cursorily and went on in a monotonous regular 
trot. In fact, that horse inspired confidence- it seemed smarter than its driver. 
But I myself could not drive so I had to rely on the horse's will. We turned into a 
suburban street, bordered on both sides by gardens. As we advanced, these gardens 
slowly changed into parks with tall trees and the parks in turn into forests.
   I shall never forget that luminous journey on that brightest of winter nights. 
   The coloured map of the heavens expanded into an immense dome, on which there 
loomed fantastic lands, oceans and seas, marked with the lines of stellar currents 
and eddies, with the brilliant streaks of heavenly geography. The air became light 
to breathe and shimmered like silver gauze. One could smell violets. From under the 
white woolly lambskin of snow, trembling anemones appeared with a speck of 
moonlight in each delicate cup. The whole forest seemed to be illuminated by 
thousands of lights and by the stars falling in profusion from the December sky. 
The air pulsated with a secret spring, with the matchless purity of snow and 
violets. We entered a hilly landscape. The lines of hills, bristling with the bare 
spikes of trees, rose like sighs of bliss. I saw on these happy slopes groups of 
wanderers, gathering among the moss and the bushes the fallen stars which now were 
damp from snow. The road became steep, the horse began to slip on it and pulled the 
creaking cab only with an effort. I was happy. My lungs soaked up the blissful 
spring in the air, the freshness of snow and stars. Before the horse's breast the 
rampart of white snowy foam grew higher and higher, and it could hardly wade 
through that pure fresh mass. At last we stopped. I got out of the cab. The horse 
was panting, hanging its head. I hugged its head to my breast and saw that there 
were tears in its large eyes. I noticed a round black wound on its belly. "Why did 
not you tell me?" I whispered, crying. "My dearest, I did it for you," the horse 
said and became very small, like a wooden toy. I left him and felt wonderfully 
light and happy. I was debating whether to wait for the small local train which 
passed through here or to walk back to the city. I began to walk down a steep path, 
winding like a serpent amidst the forest; at first in a light, elastic step; later, 
passing into a brisk, happy run which became gradually faster, until it resembled a 
gliding descent on skis. I could regulate my speed at will and change course by 
light movements of my body.
   On the outskirts of the city, I slowed this triumphal run and changed it into a 
sedate walk. The moon still rode high in the sky. The transformations of the sky, 
the metamorphoses of its multiple domes into ever more complicated configurations 
were endless. Like a silver astrolabe the sky disclosed on that magic night its 
internal mechanism and showed in infinite evolutions the mathematics of its cogs 
and wheels.
   In the market square I met some people enjoying a walk. All of them, enchanted 
by the displays of that night, walked with uplifted faces, silvery from the magic 
of the sky. I completely stopped worrying about father's wallet. My father, 
absorbed by his manias, had probably forgotten its loss by now, and as for my 
mother, I did not much care.
   On such a night, unique in the year, one has happy thoughts and inspirations, 
one feels touched by the divine finger of poetry. Full of ideas and projects, I 
wanted to walk towards my home, but met some school friends with books under their 
arms. They were on their way to school already, having been wakened by the 
brightness of that night that would not end.
   We went for a walk all together along a steeply falling street, pervaded by the 
scent of violets; uncertain whether it was the magic of the night which lay like 
silver on the snow or whether it was the light of dawn...
   
   
  THE COMET
  
  THAT YEAR the end of the winter stood under the sign of particularly favorable 
astronomical aspects. The predictions in the calendar flourished in red in the 
snowy margins of the mornings. The brighter red of Sundays and Holy days cast its 
reflection on half the week and these weekdays burned coldly, with a freak, rapid 
flame. Human hearts beat more quickly for a moment, misled and blinded by the 
redness, which, in fact, announced nothing, being merely a premature alert, a 
colorful lie of the calendar, painted in bright cinnabar on the jacket of the week. 
From Twelfth Night onwards, we sat night after night over the white parade-ground 
of the table gleaming with candlesticks and silver, and played endless games of 
patience. Every hour, the night beyond the windows became lighter, sugarcoated and 
shiny, filled with sprouting almonds and sweetmeats. The moon, that most inventive 
transmogrifier, wholly engrossed in her lunar practices, accomplished her 
successive phases and grew ever brighter and brighter. Already by day, the moon 
stood in the wings, prematurely ready for her cue, brassy and lustreless. Meanwhile 
whole flocks of feather clouds passed like sheep across her profile on their silent 
white extensive wandering, barely covering her with the shimmering mother-of-pearl 
scales into which the firmament froze towards the evening.
   Later on, the pages of days turned emptily. The wind roared over the roofs, blew 
through the cold chimneys to the very hearths, built over the city imaginary 
scaffoldings and grandstands and then destroyed these resounding air-filled 
structures with a clatter of planks and beams. Sometimes, a fire would start in a 
distant suburb. The chimney-sweeps explored the city at roof level among the gables 
under a gaping verdigris sky. Climbing from one foothold to another, on the weather 
vanes and flagpoles, they dreamed that the wind would open for them for a moment 
the lids of roofs over the alcoves of young girls and close them again immediately 
on the great stormy book of the city-providing them with breathtaking reading 
matter for many days and nights.
   Then the wind grew weary and blew itself out. The shop assistants dressed the 
shop window with spring fabrics and soon the air became milder from the soft 
colours of these woollens. It turned lavender blue, it flowered with pale reseda. 
The snow shrank, folded itself up into an infant fleece, evaporated drily into the 
air, drunk by the cobalt breezes, and was absorbed again by the vast sunless and 
cloudless sky. Oleanders in pots began to flower here and there inside the houses, 
windows remained open for longer, and the thoughtless chirping of sparrows filled 
the room, dreaming in the dull blue day. Over the cleanly swept squares, tom tits 
and chaffinches clashed for a moment in violent skirmishes with an alarming 
twittering, and then scattered in all directions, blown away by the breeze, erased, 
annihilated in the empty azure. For a second, the eyes held the memory of coloured 
speckles-a handful of confetti flung blindly into the air-then they dissolved in 
the fundus of the eye.
   The premature spring season began. The advocates' juniors twirled their 
moustaches, turning up the ends, wore high stiff collars and were paragons of 
elegance and fashion. On days hollowed out by winds as by a flood, when gales 
roared high above the city, the young lawyers greeted the ladies of their 
acquaintance from a distance, doffing their sombre coloured bowler hats and leaning 
their backs against the wind so that their coat tails opened wide. They then 
immediately averted their eyes, with a show of self-denial and delicacy so as not 
to expose their beloved to unnecessary gossip. The ladies momentarily lost the 
ground under their feet, exclaimed with alarm amidst their billowing skirts and, 
regaining their balance, returned the greeting with a smile.
	In the afternoon the wind would sometimes calm down. On the balcony Adela 
began to clean the large brass saucepans that clattered metallically under her 
touch. The sky stood immobile over the shingle roofs, stock-still, then folded 
itself into blue streaks. The shop assistants, sent over from the shop on errands, 
lingered endlessly by Adela on the threshold of the kitchen, propped against the 
balcony rails, drunk from the day-long wind, confused by the deafening twitter of 
sparrows. From the distance, the breeze brought the faint chorus of barrel-organ. 
One could not hear the soft words which the young men sang in undertones, with an 
innocent expression but which in fact were meant to shock Adela. Stung to the 
quick, she would react violently, and, most indignant, scold them angrily, while 
her face grey and dulled from early spring dreams, would flush with anger and 
amusement. The men lowered their eyes with assumed innocence and wicked 
satisfaction at having succeeded in upsetting her.
	Days and afternoons came and went, everyday events streamed in confusion over 
the city seen from the level of our balcony, over the labyrinth of roofs and houses 
bathed in the opaque light of those grey weeks. The tinkers rushed around, shouting 
their wares. Sometimes Abraham's powerful sneeze gave comical emphasis to the 
distant, scattered tumult of the city. In a far-away square the mad Touya, driven 
to despair by the nagging of small boys, would dance her wild saraband, lifting 
high her skirt to the amusement of the crowd. A gust of wind smoothed down and 
levelled out these sounds, melted them into the monotonous, grey din, spreading 
uniformly over the sea of shingle roofs in the milky, smoky air of the afternoon. 
Adela, leaning against the balcony rails, bent over the distant, stormy roar of the 
city, caught from it all the louder accents and, with a smile put together the lost 
syllables of a song trying to join them, to read some sense into the rising and 
falling grey monotony of the day.
   It was the age of electricity and mechanics and a whole swarm of inventions was 
showered on the world by the resourcefulness of human genius. In middle class homes 
cigar sets appeared equipped with an electric lighter: you pressed a switch and a 
sheaf of electric sparks lit a wick soaked in petrol. The inventions gave rise to 
exaggerated hopes. A musical box in the shape of a Chinese pagoda would, when 
wound, begin to play a little rondo while turning like a merry-go-round. Bells 
tinkled at intervals, the doors flapped wide to show the turning barrel playing a 
snuff-box triolet. In every house electric bells were installed. Domestic life 
stood under the sign of galvanism. A spool of insulated wire became the symbol of 
the times. Young dandies demonstrated Galvani's invention in drawing rooms and were 
rewarded with radiant looks from the ladies. An electric conductor opened the way 
to women's hearts. After an experiment had succeeded, the heroes of the day blew 
kisses all round, amidst the applause of the drawing rooms.
	It was not long before the city filled with velocipedes of various sizes and 
shapes. An outlook based on philosophy became obligatory. Whoever admitted to a 
belief in progress had to draw the logical conclusion and ride a velocipede. Tile 
first to do so were of course the advocates' juniors, that vanguard of new ideas, 
with their waxed moustaches and their bowler hats, the hope and flower of youth. 
Pushing through the noisy mob, they rode through the traffic on enormous bicycles 
and tricycles which displayed their wire spokes. Placing their hands on wide 
handlebars, they manoeuvred from the high saddle the enormous hoop of the wheel and 
cut into the amused mob in a wavy line. Some of them succumbed to apostolic zeal. 
Lifting themselves on their moving pedals, as if on stirrups, they addressed the 
crowd from on high, forecasting a new happy era for mankind- salvation through the 
bicycle . . . And they rode on amid the applause of the public, bowing in all 
directions.
  And yet there was something grievously embarrassing in those splendid and 
triumphal rides, something painful and unpleasant which even at the summit of their 
success threatened to disintegrate into parody. They must have felt it themselves 
when, hanging like spiders among the delicate machinery, straddled on their pedals 
like great jumping frogs, they performed duck-like movements above the wide turning 
wheels. Only a step divided them from ridicule and they took it with despair, 
leaning over the handlebars and redoubling the speed of their ride, in a tangle of 
violent head over heels gymnastics. Can one wonder? Man was entering under false 
pretences the sphere of incredible facilities, acquired too cheaply, below cost 
price, almost for nothing, and the disproportion between outlay and gain, the 
obvious fraud on nature, the excessive payment for a trick of genius, had to be 
offset by self-parody. The cyclists rode on among elemental outbursts of laughter-
miserable victors, martyrs to their genius-so great was the comic appeal of these 
wonders of technology.
	When my brother brought an electromagnet for the first time from school, when 
with a shiver we all sensed by touch the vibrations of the mysterious life enclosed 
in an electric circuit, my father smiled a superior smile. A long-range idea was 
maturing in his mind; there merged and forged a chain of ideas he had had for a 
long time. Why did father smile to himself, why did his eyes turn up, misty, in a 
parody of mock admiration? Who can tell? Did he foresee the coarse trick, the 
vulgar intrigue, the transparent machinations behind the amazing manifestations of 
the secret force? Yet that moment marked a turning point: it was then that father 
began his laboratory experiments.
	Father's laboratory equipment was simple: a few spools of wire, a few bottles 
of acid, zinc, lead and carbon-these constituted the workshop of that very strange 
esoterist. "Matter," he said, modestly lowering his eyes and stifling a cough, 
"matter, gentlemen..." He did not finish his sentence, he left his listeners 
guessing that he was about to expose a big swindle, that all we who sat there, were 
being taken for a ride. With downcast eyes my father quietly sneered at that age-
long fetish. "Panta rei!"  he exclaimed, and indicated with a movement of his hands 
the eternal circling of substance. For a long time he had wanted to mobilise the 
forces hidden in it, to make its stiffness melt, to pave its way to universal 
penetration, to transfusion, to universal circulation in accordance with its true 
nature.
  "Principium individuationis-my foot," he used to say, thus expressing his 
limitless contempt for that guiding human principle. He threw out these words in 
passing, while running from wire to wire. He half-closed his eyes and touched 
delicately various points of the circuit, feeling for the slight differences in 
potential. He made incisions in the wire, leant over it, listening, and immediately 
moved ten steps further, to repeat the same gestures at another point of the 
circuit. He seemed to have a dozen hands and twenty senses. His brittle attention 
wandered to a hundred places at once. No point in space was free from his 
suspicions. He leant over to pierce the wire at some place and then, with a sudden 
jump backwards, he pounced at another like a cat on its prey and, missing, became 
confused. "I am sorry," he would say, addressing himself unexpectedly to the 
astonished onlooker. "I am sorry, I am concerned with that section of space which 
you are filling. Couldn't you move a little to one side for a minute?" And he 
quickly made some lightning measurements, agile and nimble as a canary twitching 
efficiently under the impulses of its sympathetic system.
	The metals dipped in acid solutions, salty and rusting in that painful bath, 
began to conduct in darkness. Awakened from their stiff lifelessness, they hummed 
monotonously, sang metallically, shone molecularly in the incessant dusk of those 
mournful and late days. Invisible charges rose in the poles and swamped them, 
escaping into the circling darkness. An imperceptible tickling, a blind prickly 
current traversed the space polarised into concentric lines of energy, into circles 
and spirals of a magnetic field. Here and there an awakened apparatus would give 
out signals, another would reply a moment later, out of turn, in hopeless 
monosyllables, dash-dot-dash in the intervals of a dull lethargy. My father stood 
amongst those wandering currents, a smile of suffering on his face, impressed by 
that stammering articulation, by the misery, shut in once and for all, irrevocably, 
which was monotonously signalling in crippled half-syllables from the unliberated 
depths.
   As a consequence of these researches, my father achieved amazing results. He 
proved for instance that an electric bell, built on the principle of Neeff's 
hammer, is an ordinary mystification. It was not man who had broken into the 
laboratory of nature, but nature that had drawn him into its machinations, 
achieving through his experiments its own obscure aims. My father would touch 
during dinner the nail of his thumb with the handle of a spoon dipped in soup, and 
suddenly Neeff's bell would begin to rattle inside the lamp. The whole apparatus 
was quite superfluous, quite unnecessary: Neeff's bell was the point of convergence 
of certain impulses of matter, which used man's ingenuity for its own purposes. It 
was Nature that willed and worked, man was nothing more than an oscillating arrow, 
the shuttle of a loom, darting here or there according to Nature's will. He was 
himself only a component, a part of Neeff's hammer.
  Somebody once mentioned "mesmerism" and my father took this up too, immediately. 
The circle of his theories had closed, he had found the missing link. According to 
his theory, man was only a transit station, a temporary junction of mesmeric 
currents, wandering hither and thither within the lap of eternal matter. All the 
inventions in which he took such pride were traps into which nature had enticed 
him, were snares of the unknown. Father's experiments began to acquire the 
character of magic and legerdemain, of a parody of juggling. I won't mention the 
numerous experiments with pigeons which, by manipulating a wand, he multiplied into 
two, four or ten, only to enclose them, with visible effort, back again into the 
wand. He would raise his hat and out they flew fluttering, one by one, returning to 
reality in their full complement and settling on the table in a wavy, mobile, 
cooing heap. Sometimes father interrupted himself at an unexpected point of the 
experiment, stood up undecided, with half-closed eyes and, after a second, ran with 
tiny steps to the entrance hall where he put his head into the chimney shaft. It 
was dark there, bleak from soot, cosy as in the very centre of nothingness, and 
warm currents of air streamed up and down. Father closed his eyes and stayed there 
for a time in that warm, black void. We all felt that the incident had little to do 
with the matters in hand, that it somehow occurred at the back stage of things we 
inwardly shut our eyes to that marginal fact which belonged to quite a different 
dimension.
	My father had in his repertoire some really depressing tricks that filled one 
with true melancholy. We had in our dining room a set of chairs with tall backs, 
beautifully carved in the realistic manner into garlands of leaves and flowers; it 
was enough for father to flip the carvings and they suddenly acquired an 
exceptionally witty physiognomy; they began to grimace and wink significantly. This 
could become extremely embarrassing, almost unbearable, for the winking took on a 
wholly definite direction, an irresistible inevitability and one or another of 
those present would suddenly exclaim: "Aunt Wanda, by God, Aunt Wanda!" The ladies 
began to scream for it really was Aunt Wanda's true image; it was more than that-it 
was she herself on a visit, sitting at table and engaging in never-ending 
discourses during which one could never get a word in edgeways. Father's miracles 
cancelled themselves out automatically, for he did not produce a ghost but the real 
Aunt Wanda in all her ordinarinees and commonness, which excluded any thought of a 
possible miracle.
	Before we relate the other events of that memorable winter, we might shortly 
mention a certain incident which has been always hushed up in our family. What 
exactly had happened to Uncle Edward? He came at that time to stay with us, 
unsuspecting, in sparkling good health and full of plans, having left his wife and 
small daughter in the country. He just came in the highest of spirits, to have a 
little change and some fun away from his family. And what happened? Father's 
experiments made a tremendous impression on him. After the first few tricks, he got 
up, took off his coat and placed himself entirely at father's disposal. Without 
reservations! He said this with a piercing direct look and stressed it with a 
strong and earnest handshake. My father understood. He made sure that Uncle had no 
traditional prejudices regarding "principium individuationis." It appeared that he 
had none, none at all. Uncle had a progressive mind and no prejudices. His only 
passion was to serve Science. 
	At first father left him a degree of freedom. He was making preparations for 
a decisive experiment. Uncle Edward took advantage of his leisure to look round in 
the city. He bought himself a bicycle of imposing dimensions and rode it around 
Market Square, looking from the height of his saddle into the windows of first 
floor flats. Passing our house, he would elegantly lift his hat to the ladies 
standing in the window. He had a twirled, upturned moustache and a small pointed 
beard. Soon however, Uncle discovered that a bicycle could not introduce him into 
the deeper secrets of mechanics, that that astonishing machine was unable to 
provide lasting metaphysical thrills. And then the experiments began, based on the 
"principium individuationis." Uncle Edward had no objections at all to being 
physically reduced, for the benefit of science, to the bare principle of Neeff's 
hammer. He agreed without regret to a gradual shedding of all his characteristics 
in order to lay bare his deepest self, in harmony, as he had felt for a long time, 
with that very principle.
  Having shut himself in his study, father began the gradual penetration into Uncle 
Edward's complicated essence by a tiring psychoanalysis which lasted for many days 
and nights. The table of the study began to fill with the isolated complexes of 
Edward's ego. At first Uncle, although much reduced, turned up for meals and tried 
to take part in our conversations. He also went once more for a ride on his 
bicycle, but soon gave it up as he felt rather incomplete. A kind of shame took 
hold of him, characteristic for the stage at which he found himself. He began to 
shun people. At the same time, father was getting ever nearer to his objective. He 
had reduced Uncle to the indispensable minimum, by removing from him one by one all 
the inessentials. He placed him high in a wall recess in the staircase, arranging 
his elements in accordance with the principle of Leclanche's reaction. The wall in 
that place was mouldy and white mildew showed on it. Without any scruples father 
took advantage of the entire stock of Uncle's enthusiasm, he spread his flex along 
the length of the entrance hall and the left wing of the house. Armed with a pair 
of steps he drove small nails into the wall of the dark passage, along the whole 
path of Uncle's present existence. Those smoky, yellow afternoons were almost 
completely dark. Father used a lighted candle with which he illuminated the mildewy 
wall at close quarters, inch by inch. I have heard it said that at the last moment 
Uncle Edward, until then heroically composed, showed a certain impatience. They say 
that there was even a violent, although belated, explosion which very nearly ruined 
the almost completed work. But the installation was ready and Uncle Edward, who all 
his life had been a model husband, father and businessman, eventually submitted 
with dignity to his final role.
	Uncle functioned excellently. There was no instance of his refusal to obey. 
Having discarded his complicated personality, in which at one time he had lost 
himself, he found at last the purity of a uniform and straightforward guiding 
principle to which he was subjected from now on. At the cost of his complexity, 
which he could manage only with difficulty, he had now achieved a simple problem-
free immortality. Was he happy? One would ask that question in vain. A question 
like this makes sense only when applied to creatures who are rich in alternative, 
possibilities, so that the actual truth can be contrasted with partly real 
probabilities and reflect itself in them. But Uncle Edward had no alternatives; the 
dichotomy "happy/unhappy" did not exist for him because he had been completely 
integrated. One had to admit to a grudging approval when one saw how punctually, 
how accurately he was functioning. Even his wife, Aunt Teresa, who followed him to 
our city, could not stop herself from pressing the button quite often, in order to 
hear that loud and sonorous sound in which she recognised the former timbre of her 
husband's voice in moments of irritation. As to their daughter, Edy, one might say 
that she was fascinated by her father's career. Later, it is true, she took it out 
on me, avenging my father's action, but that is part of a different story.

II

	The days passed, the afternoons grew longer: there was nothing to do in them. 
The excess of time, still raw, still sterile and without use, lengthened the 
evenings with empty dusks. Adela, after washing up early and clearing the kitchen, 
stood idly on the balcony looking vacantly at the pale redness of the evening 
distance. Her beautiful eyes, so expressive at other times, were blank from dull 
reveries, protruding, large and shining. Her complexion, at the end of winter 
matted and grey from kitchen smells, now, under the influence of the springwards 
gravitation of the moon which was waxing from quarter to quarter, became younger, 
acquired milky reflexes, opaline shades and the glaze of enamel. She now had the 
whip hand over the shop assistants who cringed under her dark looks, discarded the 
role of would-be cynics, frequenters of city taverns and other places of ill 
repute, and, enraptured by her new beauty, sought a different method of approach, 
ready to make concessions towards putting the relationship on a new basis and to 
recognise positive facts.
	Father's experiments did not, in spite of expectations, produce any 
revolution in the life of the community. The grafting of mesmerism on the body of 
modern physics did not prove fertile. It was not because there was no grain of 
truth in father's discoveries. But truth is not a decisive factor for the success 
of an idea. Our metaphysical hunger is limited and can be satisfied quickly. Father 
was just standing on the threshold of new revelations when we, the ranks of his 
adherents and followers, began to succumb to discouragement and anarchy. The signs 
of impatience became ever more frequent: there were even open protestations. Our 
nature rebelled against the relaxation of fundamental laws, we were fed up with 
miracles and wished to return to the old, familiar, solid prose of the eternal 
order. And father understood this. He understood that he had gone too far, and put 
a rein on the flight of his fancies. The circle of elegant female disciples and 
male followers with waxed moustaches began to melt away day by day. Father, wishing 
to withdraw with honour, was intending to give a final concluding lecture, when 
suddenly a new event turned everybody's attention in a completely unexpected 
direction.
   One day my brother, on his return from school, brought the improbable and yet 
true news of the imminent end of the world. We asked him to repeat it, thinking 
that we had misheard. We hadn't. This is what that incredible, that completely 
baffling piece of news was: unready and unfinished, just as it was, at a random 
point in time and space, without closing its accounts, without having reached any 
goal, in mid-sentence as it were, without a full stop or exclamation mark, without 
a last judgement or God's Wrath-in an atmosphere of friendly understanding, 
loyally, by mutual agreement and in accordance with rules observed by both parties-
the world was to be hit on the head, simply and irrevocably. No, it was not to be 
an eschatological, tragic finale as forecast long ago by the prophets, nor the last 
act of the Divine Comedy. No. It was to be a trick cyclist's, a prestidigitator's, 
end of the world, splendidly hocus-pocus and bogus-experimental- accompanied by the 
plaudits of all the spirits of Progress. There was almost no one to whom the idea 
would not appeal. The frightened, the protesters, were immediately hushed up. Why 
did not they understand that this was a simply incredible chance, the most 
progressive, freethinking end of the world imaginable, in line with the spirit of 
the times, an honourable end, a credit to the Supreme Wisdom? People discussed it 
with enthusiasm, drew pictures "ad oculos" on pages torn from pocket notebooks, 
provided irrefutable proofs, knocking their opponents and the sceptics out of the 
ring. In illustrated journals whole-page pictures began to appear, drawings of the 
anticipated catastrophe with effective staging. These usually represented panic-
stricken populous cities under a night sky resplendent with lights and astronomical 
phenomena. One saw already the astonishing action of the distant comet, whose 
parabolic summit remained in the sky in immobile flight, still pointing towards the 
earth, and approaching it at a speed of many miles per second. As in a circus 
farce, hats and bowlers rose into the air, hair stood on end, umbrellas opened by 
themselves and bald patches were disclosed under escaping wigs-and above it all 
there spread a black enormous sky, shimmering with the simultaneous alert of all 
the stars.
	Something festive had entered our lives, an eager enthusiasm. An importance 
permeated our gestures and swelled our chests with cosmic sighs. The earthly globe 
seethed at night with a solemn uproar from the unanimous ecstasy of thousands. The 
nights were black and vast. The nebulae of stars around the earth became more 
numerous and denser. In the dark interplanetary spaces these stars appeared in 
different positions, strewing the dust of meteors from abyss to abyss. Lost in the 
infinite, we had almost forsaken the earthly globe under our feet; we were 
disorientated, losing our bearings; we hung head down like antipodes over the 
upturned zenith and wandered over the starry heaps, moving a wetted finger across 
maps of the sky, from star to star. Thus we meandered in extended, disorderly, 
single file, scattering in all directions on the rungs of the infinite ladders of 
the night- emigrants from the abandoned globe, plundering the immense antheap of 
stars. The last barriers fell, the cyclists rode into stellar space, rearing on 
their vehicles, and were perpetuated in an immobile flight in the interplanetary 
vacuum, which revealed ever new constellations. Thus circling on an endless track, 
they marked the paths of a sleepless cosmography, while in reality, black as soot, 
they succumbed to a planetary lethargy, as if they had put their heads into the 
fireplace, the final goal of all those blind flights.
	After short, incoherent days, partly spent in sleeping, the nights opened up 
like an enormous, populated motherland. Crowds filled the streets, turned out in 
public squares, head close to head, as if the top of a barrel of caviar had been 
removed and it was now flowing out in a stream of shiny buckshot, a dark river 
under a pitch-black night noisy with stars. The stairs broke under the weight of 
thousands, at all the upper floor windows little figures appeared, matchstick 
people jumping over the rails in a moonstruck fervour, making living chains, like 
ants, living structures and columns-one astride another's shoulders- flowing down 
from windows to the platforms of squares lit by the glare of burning tar barrels.
   I must beg forgiveness if in describing these scenes of enormous crowds and 
general uproar, I tend to exaggerate, modelling myself unwittingly on certain old 
engravings in the great book of disasters and catastrophes of the human species. 
But they all create a pre-image and the megalomanic exaggeration, the enormous 
pathos of all these scenes proved that we had removed the bottom of the eternal 
barrel of memories, of an ultra-barrel of myth, and had broken into a pre-human 
night of untamed elements, of incoherent anamnesis, and could not hold back the 
swelling flood. Ah, these nights filled with stars shimmering like fish-scales! Ah, 
these banks of mouths incessantly swallowing in small gulps, in hungry draught, the 
swelling undrunk streams of those dark rain-drenched nights! In what fatal nets, in 
what miserable trammels did those multiplicated generations end?
	Oh, skies of those days, skies of luminous signals and meteors, covered by 
the calculations of astronomers, copied a thousand times, numbered, marked with the 
watermarks of algebra! With faces blue from the glory of those nights, we wandered 
through space pulsating from the explosions of distant suns, in a sidereal 
brightness-human ants, spreading in a broad heap on the sandbanks of the milky way 
spilled over the whole sky-a human river over-shadowed by the cyclists on their 
spidery machines. Oh, stellar arena of night, scarred by the evolutions, spirals 
and leaps of those nimble riders; oh, cycloids and epi-cycloids executed in 
inspiration along the diagonals of the sky, amidst lost wire spokes, hoops shed 
with indifference, to reach the bright goal denuded, with nothing but the pure idea 
of cycling! From these days dates a new constellation, the thirteenth group of 
stars, included forever in the Zodiac and resplendent since then in the firmament 
of our nights: THE CYCLIST.
   The houses, wide open at night during that time, remained empty in the light of 
violently flickering lamps. The curtains blew out far into the night and the rows 
of rooms stood in an all-embracing, incessant draught, which shot through them in 
violent, relentless alarm. It was Uncle Edward sounding the alert. Yes, at last he 
had lost patience, cut off his bonds, trod down the categorical imperative, broken 
away from the rigours of high morals, and sounded the alarm. One tried to silence 
him with the help of a long stick, one put kitchen rags to stop the violent 
explosions of sound. But even gagged in this way he never stopped agitating, he 
rang madly, without respite, without heed that his life was flowing away from him 
in the continuous rattling, that he was bleeding white in everybody's sight, beyond 
held, in a fatal frenzy.
	Occasionally someone would rush into the empty rooms pierced by that devilish 
ringing under the glowing lamps, take a few hesitant steps on tiptoe and stop 
abruptly as if looking for something. The mirrors took him speechlessly into their 
transparent depths and divided him in silence between themselves. Uncle Edward was 
ringing to high heaven through all these bright and empty rooms. The lonely 
deserter from the stars, conscience stricken, as if he had come to commit an evil 
deed, retreated stealthily from the flat, deafened by the constant ringing. He went 
to the front door accompanied by the vigilant mirrors which let him through their 
shiny ranks, while into their depth there tiptoed a swarm of doubles with fingers 
to their lips.
	Again the sky opened above us with its vastness strewn with stellar dust. 'n 
that sky, at an early hour of each night appeared that fatal Comet, hanging aslant, 
at the apex of its parabola, aiming unerringly at the earth and swallowing many 
miles per second. All eyes were directed at him, while he, shining metallically, 
oblong in shape, slightly brighter in his protuberant middle, performed his daily 
work with mathematical precision. How difficult it was to believe that that small 
worm, innocently glowing among the innumerable swarms of stars, was the fiery 
finger of Balthasar, writing on the blackboard of the sky the perdition of our 
globe. But every child knew by heart the fatal formula expressed in the logarithm 
of a multiple integer, from which our inescapable destruction would result. What 
was there to save us?
  While the mob scattered in the open, losing itself under the starry lights and 
celestial phenomena, my father remained stealthily at home. He was the only one who 
knew a secret escape from our trap, the back door of cosmology. He smiled secretly 
to himself. While Uncle Edward, choked with rags, was desperately sounding the 
alarm, father silently put his head into the chimney shaft of the stove. It was 
black and quiet there. It smelled of warm air, of soot, of silence, of stillness. 
Father made himself comfortable and sat blissfully, his eyes closed. Into that 
black carapace of the house, emerging over the roof into the starry night, there 
entered the frail light of a star and breaking as if in the glass of a telescope 
lit a spark in the hearth, a tiny seed in the dark retort of the chimney. Father 
was slowly turning the screw of a microscope and the fatal creation, bright like 
the moon, brought near to arm's length by the lens, plastic and shining with a 
limestone relief in the silent blackness of planetary emptiness, moved into the 
field of vision. It was slightly scrofulous, somewhat pock-marked-that brother of 
the moon, his lost double, returning after a thousand years of wandering to the 
motherland of the Earth. My father moved it closer to his protruding eye: it was 
like a slice of Gruyere cheese riddled with holes, pale yellow, sharply lit, 
covered with white, leperous spots. His hand on the screw of the microscope, his 
gaze blinded by the light of the oculars, my father moved his cold eyes on the 
limestone globe, he saw on its surface the complicated print of the disease gnawing 
at it from inside, the curved channels of the book-worm, burrowing under the 
cheesy, unhealthy surface. Father shivered and saw his mistake: no, this was not 
Gruyere cheese, this was obviously a human brain, an anatomical crosscut 
preparation of the brain in all its complicated structure. Concentrating his gaze, 
he could even decipher the tiny letters of captions running in all directions on 
the complicated map of the hemisphere. The brain seemed to have been chloroformed, 
deeply asleep and blissfully smiling in its sleep. Intrigued by its expression, my 
father saw the essence of the phenomenon through the complex surface print and 
again smiled to himself. There is no telling what one can discover in one's own 
familiar chimney, black like tobacco ash. Through the coils of grey substance, 
through the minute granulations father saw the clearly visible contours of an 
embryo in a characteristic head-over-heels position, with fists next to its face, 
sleeping upside down its blissful sleep in the light waters of amnion. Father left 
it in that position. He rose with relief and shut the trap-door of the flue.
Thus far and no further. But what has become of the end of the world, that splendid 
finale, after the magnificently developed introduction? Downcast eyes and a smile. 
Was there a slip in calculation, a small mistake in addition, a printer's error 
when the figures were being printed? Nothing of the sort. The calculations were 
correct, there was no fault in the column of figures. What had happened then? 
Please listen. The comet proceeded bravely, rode fast like an ambitious horse in 
order to reach the finishing post on time. The fashion of the season ran with him. 
For a time, he took the lead of the era, to which he lent his shape and name. Then 
the two gallant mounts drew even and ran neck to neck in a strained gallop, our 
hearts beating in fellow feeling with them. Later on, fashion overtook by a nose 
and outstripped the indefatigable bolide. That millimetre decided the fate of the 
comet. It was doomed, it has been outdistanced forever. Our hearts now ran along 
with fashion, leaving the splendid comet behind. We looked on indifferently as he 
became paler, smaller and finally sank resignedly to a point just above the 
horizon, leant over to one side, trying in vain to take the last bend of its 
parabolic course, distant and blue, rendered harmless for ever. He was unplaced in 
the race, the force of novelty was exhausted, nobody cared any more for a thing 
that had been outstripped so badly. Left to itself, it quietly withered away amid 
universal indifference.
  With heads hung low we reverted to our daily tasks, richer by one more 
disappointment. The cosmic perspectives were hurriedly rolled down, life returned 
to its normal course. We rested at that time by day and by night, making good for 
the lost time of sleep. We lay flat on our backs in already dark houses, heavy with 
sleep, lifted up by our breathing to the blind paths of starless dreams. Thus 
floating, we undulated-squeaky bellies, bagpipes and flutes, snoring our way 
through the pathless tracts of the starless nights. Uncle Edward had been silenced 
forever. There still remained in the air the echo of his alarmed despair, but he 
himself was alive no more. Life had flowed out of him in that paroxysm of frenzy, 
the circuit had opened, and he himself stepped out unhindered onto the higher rungs 
of immortality.
   In the dark apartment my father alone was awake, wandering silently through the 
rooms filled with the sing-song of sleep. Sometimes he opened the door of the flue 
and looked grinning into its dark abyss, where a smiling Homunculus slept for ever 
its luminous sleep, enclosed in a glass capsule, bathed in fluorescent light, 
already adjudged, erased, filed away, another record card in the immense archives 
of the sky.
