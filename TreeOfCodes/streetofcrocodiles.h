AUGUST

IN JULY my father went to take the waters and left me, with my mother 
and elder brother, a prey to the blinding white heat of the summer days. 
Dizzy with light, we dipped into that enormous book of holidays, its 
pages blazing with sunshine and scented with the sweet melting pulp of 
golden pears.
 On those luminous mornings Adela returned from the market, like 
Pomona emerging from the flames of day, spilling from her basket the 
colourful beauty of the sun-the shiny pink cherries full of juice under 
their transparent skins, the mysterious black morellos that smelled so 
much better than they tasted; apricots in whose golden pulp lay the core 
of long afternoons. And next to that pure poetry of fruit, she unloaded 
sides of meat with their keyboard of ribs swollen with energy and 
strength, and seaweeds of vegetables like dead octopuses and squids-the 
raw material of meals with a yet undefined taste, the vegetative and 
terrestrial ingredients of dinner, exuding a wild and rustic smell.
 The dark first floor apartment of the house in Market Square was 
shot through each day by the naked heat of summer: the silence of the 
shimmering streaks of air, the squares of brightness dreaming their 
intense dreams on the floor; the sound of a barrel-organ rising from the 
deepest golden vein of day; two or three bars of a chorus, played on a 
distant piano over and over again, melting in the sun on the white 
pavement, lost in the fire of high noon.
 After tidying up, Adela would plunge the rooms into semi-darkness 
by drawing down the linen blinds. All colours immediately fell an octave 
lower, the room filled with shadows, as if it had sunk to the bottom of 
the sea and the light was reflected in mirrors of green water- and the 
heat of the day began to breathe on the blinds as they stirred slightly 
in their day-dreams.
  On Saturday afternoons I used to go for a walk with my mother. 
From the dusk of the hallway, we stepped at once into the brightness of 
the day. The passers-by, bathed in melting gold, had their eyes half 
closed against the glare, as if they were drenched with honey. Upper 
lips were drawn back, exposing the teeth. Everyone in this golden day 
wore that grimace of heat-as if the sun had forced his worshippers to 
wear identical masks of gold. The old and the young, women and children, 
greeted each other with these masks, painted on their faces with thick 
gold paint; they smiled at each other's pagan faces-the barbaric smiles 
of Bacchus.

 Market Square was empty and white hot, swept by hot winds like a 
biblical desert. The thorny acacias, growing in this emptiness, looked 
with their bright leaves like the trees on old tapestries. Although 
there was no breath of wind, they rustled their foliage in a theatrical 
gesture, as if wanting to display the elegance of the silver lining of 
their leaves that resembled the fox-fur lining of a nobleman's coat. The 
old houses, worn smooth by the winds of innumerable days, played tricks 
with the reflections of the atmosphere, with echoes and memories of 
colours scattered in the depth of the cloudless sky. It seemed as if 
whole generations of summer days, like patient stonemasons cleaning the 
mildewed plaster from old facades, had removed the deceptive varnish, 
revealing more and more clearly the true face of the houses, the 
features that fate had given them and life had shaped for them from the 
inside. Now the windows, blinded by the glare of the empty square, had 
fallen asleep; the balconies declared their emptiness to heaven; the 
open doorways smelt of coolness and wine.

 A bunch of ragamuffins, sheltering in a corner of the square from 
the flaming broom of the heat, beleaguered a piece of wall, throwing 
buttons and coins at it over and over again, as if wishing to read in 
the horoscope of those metal discs the real secret written in the 
hieroglyphics of cracks and scratched lines. Apart from them, the square 
was deserted. One expected that, any minute, the Samaritan's donkey, led 
by the bridle, would stop in front of the wine-merchant's vaulted 
doorway and that two servants would carefully ease a sick man from the 
red-hot saddle and carry him slowly up the cool stairs to the floor 
above, already redolent of the Sabbath.

 Thus my mother and I ambled along the two sunny sides of Market 
Square, guiding our broken shadows along the houses as over a keyboard. 
Under our soft steps the squares of the paving stones slowly filed past-
some the pale pink of human skin, some golden, some blue-grey, all flat, 
warm and velvety in the sun, like sun-dials, trodden to the point of 
obliteration, into blessed nothingness.

 And finally on the corner of Stryjska Street we passed within the 
shadow of the chemist's shop. A large jar of raspberry juice in the wide 
window symbolised the coolness of balms which can relieve all kinds of 
pain. After we passed a few more houses, the street ceased to maintain 
any pretence of urbanity like a man returning to his little village who, 
piece by piece, strips off his Sunday best, slowly changing back into a 
peasant as he gets closer to his home.
 The suburban houses were sinking, windows and all, into the 
exuberant tangle of blossom in their little gardens. Overlooked by the 
light of day, weeds and wild flowers of all kinds luxuriated quietly, 
glad of the interval for dreams beyond the margin of time on the borders 
of an endless day. An enormous sunflower, lifted on a powerful stem and 
suffering from hypertrophy, clad in the yellow mourning of the last 
sorrowful days of its life, bent under the weight of its monstrous 
girth. But the naive, suburban bluebells and unpretentious dimity 
flowers stood helpless in their starched pink and white shifts, 
indifferent to the sunflower's tragedy.

II

A tangled thicket of grasses, weeds and thistles crackled in the fire of 
the afternoon. The sleeping garden was resonant with flies. The golden 
field of stubble shouted in the sun like a tawny cloud of locusts; in 
the thick rain of fire the crickets screamed; seed pods exploded softly 
like grasshoppers.
  And over by the fence the sheepskin of grass lifted in a hump, as 
if the garden had turned over in its sleep, its broad, peasant back 
rising and falling as it breathed on the stillness of the earth. There 
the untidy, feminine ripeness of August had expanded into enormous, 
impenetrable, clumps of burdocks spreading their sheets of leafy tin, 
their luxuriant tongues of fleshy greenery. There, those protuberant bur 
clumps spread themselves, like resting peasant women, half enveloped in 
their own swirling skirts. There, the garden offered free of charge the 
cheapest fruits of wild lilac, the heady aquavit of mint and all kinds 
of August trash. But on the other side of the fence, behind that jungle 
of summer in which the stupidity of weeds reigned unchecked, there was a 
rubbish heap on which thistles grew in wild profusion. No one knew that 
there, on that refuse dump, the month of August had chosen to hold that 
year its pagan orgies. There, pushed against the fence and hidden by the 
elders, stood the bed of the halfwit girl, Touya, as we all called her. 
On a heap of discarded junk of old saucepans, abandoned single shoes and 
chunks of plaster, stood a bed, painted green, propped up on two bricks 
where one leg was missing.

 The air over that midden, wild with the heat, cut through by the 
lightning of shiny horseflies, driven mad by the sun, crackled, as if 
filled with invisible rattles, exciting one to frenzy.

 Touya sits hunched up among the yellow bedding and odd rags, her 
large head covered by a mop of tangled black hair. Her face works like 
the bellows of an accordion. Every now and then a sorrowful grimace 
folds it into a thousand vertical pleats, but astonishment soons 
straightens it out again, ironing out the folds, revealing the chinks of 
small eyes and damp guns with yellow teeth under snout-like, fleshy 
lips. Hours pass, filled with heat and boredom; Touya chatters in a 
monotone, dozes, mumbles softly and coughs. Her immobile frame is 
covered by a thick cloak of flies. But suddenly the whole heap of dirty 
rags begins to move, as if stirred by the scratching of a litter of 
newlyborn rats. The flies wake up in fright and rise in a huge, 
furiously buzzing cloud, filled with coloured light reflected from the 
sun. And while the rags slip to the ground and spread out over the 
rubbish heap, like frightened rats, a form emerges and reveals itself: 
the dark halfnaked idiot girl rises slowly to her feet and stands like a 
pagan idol, on short childish legs; her neck swells with anger, and from 
her face, red with fury, on which the arabesques of bulging veins stand 
out as in a primitive painting, comes forth a hoarse animal scream, 
originating deep in the lungs hidden in that half-animal, half-divine 
breast. The sun-dried thistles shout, the plantains swell and boast 
their shameless flesh, the weeds salivate with glistening poison, and 
the half-wit girl, hoarse with shouting, convulsed with madness, presses 
her fleshy belly in an excess of lust against the trunk of an elder 
which groans softly under the insistent pressure of that libidinous 
passion, incited by the whole ghastly chorus to hideous unnatural 
fertility.

 Touya's mother Maria hired herself to housewives to scrub floors. 
She was a small saffron-yellow woman, and it was with saffron that she 
wiped the floors, the deal tables, the benches and the bannisters which 
she scrubbed in the homes of the poor.

 Once Adela took me to the old woman's house. It was early in the 
morning when we entered the small blue-walled room, with its mud floor, 
lying in a patch of bright yellow sunlight in the still of the morning 
broken only by the frighteningly loud ticking of a cottage clock on the 
wall. In a straw-filled chest lay the foolish Maria, white as a wafer 
and motionless like a glove from which a hand had been withdrawn. And, 
as if taking advantage of her sleep, the silence talked, the yellow, 
bright evil silence delivered its monologue, argued, and loudly spoke 
its vulgar maniacal soliloquy. Maria's time the time imprisoned in her 
soul-had left her and-terribly real-filled the room, vociferous and 
hellish in the bright silence of the morning, rising from the noisy mill 
of the clock like a cloud of bad flour, powdery flour, the stupid flour 
of madmen.

 III

In one of those cottages, surrounded by brown railings and submerged in 
the lush green of its garden, lived Aunt Agatha. Coming through the 
garden to visit her, we passed numerous coloured glass balls stuck on 
flimsy poles. In these pink, green and violet balls were enclosed bright 
shining worlds like the ideally happy pictures contained in the peerless 
perfection of soap bubbles.

 In the gloom of the hall, with its old lithographs, rotten with 
mildew and blind with age, we rediscovered a well-known smell. In that 
old familiar smell was contained a marvellously simple synthesis of the 
life of those people, the distillation of their race, the quality of 
their blood and the secret of their fate, imperceptibly mixed day by day 
with the passage of their own, private, time. The old, wise door, the 
silent witness of the entries and exits of mother, daughters, sons, 
whose dark sighs accompanied the comings and goings of those people, now 
opened noiselessly like the door of a wardrobe and we stepped into their 
life. They were sitting as if in the shadow of their own destiny and did 
not fight against it; with their first, clumsy gestures they revealed 
their secret to us. Besides, were we not related to them by blood and by 
fate?

 The room was dark and velvety from the royal blue wallpaper with 
its gold pattern, but even here the echo of the flaming day shimmered 
brassily on the picture frames, on door knobs and gilded borders, 
although it came through the filter of the dense greenery of the garden. 
From her chair against the wall, Aunt Agatha rose to greet us, tall and 
ample, her round white flesh blotchy with the rust of freckles. We sat 
down beside them, as on the verge of their lives, rather embarrassed by 
their defenseless surrender to us, and we drank water with rose syrup, a 
wonderful drink in which I found the deepest essence of that hot 
Saturday.

 My aunt was complaining. It was the principal burden of her 
conversation, the voice of that white and fertile flesh, floating as it 
were outside the boundaries of her person, held only loosely in the 
fetters of
 individual form, and, despite those fetters, ready to multiply, to 
scatter, branch out, and divide into a family. It was an almost 
selfpropagating fertility, a femininity without rein, morbidly 
expansive.

 It seemed as if the very whiff of masculinity, the smell of 
tobacco smoke, or a bachelor's joke, would spark off this feverish 
femininity and entice it to a lascivious virgin-birth. And in fact, all 
her complaints about her husband or her servants, all her worries about 
the children were only the caprices of her incompletely satisfied 
fertility, a logical extension of the rude, angry, lachrymose coquetry 
with which, to no purpose, she plagued her husband. Uncle Mark, small 
and hunched, with a face fallow of sex, sat in his grey bankruptcy, 
reconciled to his fate, in the shadow of a limitless contempt in which 
he seemed only to relax. His grey eyes reflected the distant glow of the 
garden, spreading in the window.

 Sometimes he tried with a feeble gesture to raise an objection, to 
resist, but the wave of self-sufficient femininity hurled aside that 
unimportant gesture, triumphantly passed him by, and drowned the feeble 
stirrings of male assertiveness under its broad flood.

 There was something tragic in that immoderate fertility; the 
misery of a creature fighting on the borders of nothingness and death, 
the heroism of womanhood triumphing by fertility over the shortcomings 
of nature, over the insufficiency of the male. But their offspring 
showed justification for that panic of maternity, of a passion for child 
bearing which became exhausted in ill-starred pregnancies, in an 
ephemereal generation of phantoms without blood or face.

 Lucy, the second eldest, now entered the room, her head 
overdeveloped for her child-like, plump body, her flesh white and 
delicate. She stretched out to me a small doll-like hand, a hand in bud, 
and blushed all over her face like a peony. Unhappy because of her 
blushes, which shamelessly revealed the secrets of menstruation, she 
closed her eyes and reddened even more deeply under the touch of the 
most indifferent question, for she saw in each a secret allusion to her 
most sensitive maidenhood.
  Emil, the eldest of the cousins, with a fair moustache in a face 
from which life seemed to have washed away all expression, was walking 
up and down the room, his hands in the pockets of his voluminous 
trousers.

 His elegant expensive clothes bore the imprint of the exotic 
countries he had visited. His pale, flabby face, seemed from day to day 
to lose its outline, to become a white blank wall with a pale network of 
veins, like lines on an old map occasionally stirred by the fading 
memories of a stormy and wasted life.

 He was a master of card tricks, he smoked long, noble pipes and 
smelled strangely of distant lands. With his gaze wandering over old 
memories, he told curious stories, which at some point would suddenly 
stop, disintegrate, and blow away.

 My eyes followed him nostalgically, and I wished he would notice 
me and liberate me from the tortures of boredom. And indeed, it seemed 
as if he gave me a wink before going into an adjoining room and I 
followed him there. He was sitting on a small low sofa, his crossed 
knees almost level with his head, which was bald like a billiard ball. 
It seemed as if it were only his clothes that had been thrown, crumpled 
and empty, over a chair. His face seemed like the breath of a face-a 
smudge which an unknown passer-by had left in the air. In his white, 
blue-enamelled hands he was holding a wallet and looking at something in 
it.

 From the mist of his face, the protruding white of a pale eye 
emerged with difficulty, enticing me with a wink. I felt an irresistable 
sympathy for Emil.

 He took me between his knees and, shuffling some photographs in 
front of my eyes as if they were a pack of cards, he showed me naked 
women and boys in strange positions. I stood leaning against him looking 
at those delicate human bodies with distant, unseeing eyes, when all of 
a sudden the fluid of an obscure excitement with which the air seemed 
charged, reached me and pierced me with a shiver of uneasiness, a wave 
of sudden comprehension. But meanwhile that ghost of a smile which had 
appeared under Emil's soft and beautiful moustache, the seed of desire 
which had shown in a pulsating vein on his temple, the tenseness which 
for a moment had kept his features concentrated, all fell away again and 
his face receded into indifference and became absent and finally faded 
away altogether.


VISITATION

ALREADY for some time our town had been sinking into the perpetual greyness of dusk, had become affected at the edges by a rash of shadows, by fluffy mildew and by moss the dull colour of iron.
   Hardly was it freed from the brown smoke and the mists of the morning, than the day turned into a lowering amber afternoon, became for a brief moment transparent, taking the golden colour of ale, only to ascend under the multiple fantastic domes of vast, colour filled nights.
   We lived in Market Square, in one of those dark houses with empty blind looks, so difficult to distinguish one from the other.
   This gave endless possibilities for mistakes. For, once you had entered the wrong doorway and set foot on the wrong staircase, you were liable to find yourself in a real labyrinth of unfamiliar apartments and balconies, and unexpected doors opening on to strange empty courtyards, and you forgot the initial object of the expedition, only to recall it days later after numerous strange and complicated adventures, on regaining the family home in the grey light of dawn.
   Full of large wardrobes, vast sofas, faded mirrors and cheap artificial palms, our apartment sank ever deeper into a state of neglect owing to the indolence of my mother, who spent most of her time in the shop, and the carelessness of slim-legged Adela who, without anyone to supervise her, spent her days in front of a mirror, endlessly making up and leaving everywhere tufts of combed out hair, brushes, odd slippers and discarded corsets.
   No one ever knew exactly how many rooms we had in our flat, because no one ever remembered how many of them were let to strangers. Often one would by chance open the door to one of these
forgotten rooms to find it empty; the lodger had moved out a long time ago. In the drawers, untouched for months, one would make unexpected discoveries.

   In the downstairs rooms lived the shop-assistants and sometimes during the night we were awakened by their nightmares. In winter it would be still deep night when father went down to these cold and dark rooms, the light of his candle scattering flocks of shadows so that they fled sideways along the floor and up the walls; his task to wake the snoring men from their stone-hard sleep.

   In the light of the candle, which father left with them, they unwound themselves lazily from the dirty bedding, then, sitting on the edge of their beds, stuck out their bare and ugly feet and, with socks in their hands, abandoned themselves for a moment to the delights of yawning-a yawning crossing the borders of sensuous pleasure, leading to a painful cramp of the palate, almost to nausea.

   In the corners, large cockroaches sat immobile, hideously enlarged by their own shadows which the burning candle imposed on them and which remained attached to their flat, headless bodies when they suddenly ran off with weird, spider-like movements.

   At that time, my father's health began to fail. liven in the first weeks of this early winter, he would spend whole days in bed, surrounded by bottles of medicine and boxes of pills, and ledgers brought up to him from the shop. The bitter smell of illness settled like a rug in the room and the arabesques on the wallpaper loomed darker.

   In the evenings, when mother returned from the shop, father was often excited and inclined to argue.

   As he reproached her for inaccuracies in the accounts his cheeks became flushed and he became almost insane with anger. I remember more than once waking in the middle of the night to see him in his nightshirt, running in his bare feet up and down the leather sofa to demonstrate his irritation to my baffled mother.

   On other days he was calm and composed, completely absorbed in the account books, lost in a maze of complicated calculations.
   I can still see him in the light of the smoking lamp, crouched among his pillows under the large carved headboard of the bed, swaying backwards and forwards in silent meditation, his head making an enormous shadow on the wall.

   From time to time, he raised his eyes from the ledgers as if to come up for air, opened his mouth, smacked his lips with distaste as if his tongue were dry and bitter, and looked around helplessly, as if searching for something.

   It then sometimes happened that he quietly got out of bed and ran to the corner of the room, where an intimate instrument hung on the wall. It was a kind of hour-glass shaped water-jar marked in ounces and filled with a dark fluid. My father attached himself to it with a long rubber hose as if with a gnarled, aching navel-cord, and thus connected with the miserable apparatus, he became tense with concentration, his eyes darkened and an expression of suffering, or perhaps of forbidden pleasure, spread over his pale face.

   Then again came days of quiet, concentrated work, interrupted by lonely monologues. While he sat there in the light of the lamp among the pillows of the large bed, and the room grew enormous as the shadows above the lampshade merged with the deep city night beyond the windows, he felt, without looking, how the pullulating jungle of wallpaper, filled with whispers, lisping and hissing, closed in around him. He heard, without looking, a conspiracy of knowingly winking hidden eyes, of alert ears opening up among the flowers on the wall, of dark, smiling mouths.

   He then pretended to become ever more engrossed in his work, adding and calculating, trying not to betray the anger which rose in him and overcoming the temptation to throw himself blindly forward with a sudden shout to grab fistfuls of those curly arabesques, or of those sheaves of eyes and ears which swarmed out from the night and grew and multiplied, sprouting, with ever new ghostlike shoots and branches, from the womb of darkness. And he calmed down only when, in the morning with the ebb of night, the wallpaper wilted, shed its leaves and petals and thinned down autumnally, letting in the distant dawn.

   Then, among the twittering of wallpaper birds in the yellow wintry dawn, he would fall, for a few hours, into a heavy black sleep.

   For days, even for weeks, while he seemed to be engrossed in the complicated current accounts-his thoughts had been secretly plumbing the depths of his own entrails. He would hold his breath and listen. And when his gaze returned, pale and troubled, from that labyrinth, he calmed it with a smile. He did not wish to believe those assumptions and suggestions which oppressed him, and rejected them as absurd.

   In daytime, these were more like arguments and persuasions; long monotonous reasonings, conducted half aloud and with humorous interludes of teasing and banter. But at night these voices rose with greater passion. The demands were made more clearly and more loudly, and we heard him talk to God, as if begging for something or fighting against someone who made insistent claims and issued orders.

   Until one night that voice rose threateningly and irresistibly, demanding that he should bear witness to it with his mouth and with his entrails. And we heard the spirit enter into him as he rose from his bed, tall and growing in prophetic anger, choking with brash words which he emitted like a machine-gun. We heard the din of battle and father's groans, the groans of a titan with a broken hip, but still capable of wrath.

   I have never seen an Old Testament prophet, but at the sight of this man stricken by God's fire, sitting clumsily on an enormous china chamberpot behind a windmill of arms, a screen of desperate wrigglings over which there towered his voice, grown unfamiliar and hard, I understood the divine anger of saintly men.

   It was a dialogue as grim as the language of thunder. The jerkings of his arms cut the sky into pieces, and in the cracks there appeared the face of Jehovah swollen with anger and spitting out curses. Without looking, I saw him, the terrible Demiurge, as, resting on darkness as on Sinai, propping his powerful palms on the pelmet of the curtains, he pressed his enormous face against the upper panes of the window which flattened horribly his large fleshy nose.

   I heard my father's voice during the intermissions in these prophetic tirades. I heard the windows shake from the powerful growl of the swollen lips, mixed with the explosions of entreaties, laments and threats uttered by father.

   Sometimes the voices quietened down and grumbled softly like the nightly chatter of wind in a chimney, then again they exploded with a large, tumultuous noise, in a storm of sobs mixed with curses. Suddenly the window opened with a dark yawn and a sheet of darkness wafted across the room.

   In a flash of lightning I could see my father, his nightshirt unbuttoned, as, cursing terribly, he emptied with a masterful gesture the contents of the chamberpot into the darkness below.

My father was slowly fading, wilting before our eyes.

   Hunched amongst the enormous pillows, his grey hair standing wildly on end, he talked to himself in under-tones, engrossed in some complicated private business. It seemed as if his personality had split into a number of opposing and quarrelling selves; he argued loudly with himself, persuading forcibly and passionately, pleading and begging; then again he seemed to be presiding over a meeting of many interested parties whose views he tried to reconcile with a great show of energy and conviction. But every time these noisy meetings, during which tempers would rise violently, dissolved into curses, execrations, maledictions and insults.

   Then came a period of appeasement, of an interior calm, a blessed serenity of spirit. Again the great ledgers were spread on the bed, on the table, on the floor, and an almost monastic calm reigned in the light of the lamp, over the white bedding, over my father's grey, bowed head.
   But when mother returned late at night from the shop, father became animated, called her and showed her with great pride the wonderful, coloured transfers with which he had laboriously adorned the pages of the main ledger.

   About that time we noticed that father began to shrink from day to day like a nut drying inside the shell.

   This shrinking was not accompanied by any loss of strength. On the contrary, there seemed to be an improvement in his general state of health, in his humour and in his mobility.

   Now he often laughed loudly and gaily; sometimes he was almost overcome with laughter; at others, he would knock on the side of the bed and answer himself: "Come in," in various tones, for hours on end. From time to time, he scrambled down from the bed, climbed on top of the wardrobe and, crouching under the ceiling, sorted out old dust-covered odds and ends.

   Sometimes he put two chairs back to back and taking his weight on them, swung his legs backwards and forwards, looking with shining eyes for an expression of admiration and encouragement in our faces. It seemed as if he had become completely reconciled with God. Sometimes at night, the face of the bearded Demiurge would appear at the bedroom window, bathed in the dark purple glare of Bengal fire, but it only looked for a moment benevolently on my sleeping father whose melodious snoring seemed to wander far into the unknown regions of the world of sleep.

   During the long twilight afternoons of this winter, my father would spend hours rummaging in corners full of old junk, as if he were feverishly searching for something.

   And sometimes at dinner time, when we had all taken our places at the table, father would be missing. On such occasions, mother had to call "Jacob!" over and over again and knock her spoon against the table before he emerged from inside a wardrobe, covered with dust and cobwebs, his eyes vacant, his mind on some complicated matter known only to himself which absorbed him completely.
   Occasionally he climbed on a pelmet and froze into immobility, a counterpart to the large stuffed vulture which hung on the wall opposite. In this crouching pose, with misty eyes and a sly smile on his lips, he remained for long periods without moving, except to flap his arms like wings and crow like a cock whenever anybody entered the room.

   We ceased to pay attention to these oddities in which father became daily more and more involved. Almost completely ridden of bodily needs, not taking any nourishment for weeks, he plunged deeper every day into some strange and complex affairs which were beyond our understanding. To all our persuasions and our entreaties, he answered in fragments of his interior monologue which nothing from the outside could disturb. Constantly absorbed, morbidly excited, with flushes on his dry cheeks he did not notice us or even hear us any more.

   We became used to his harmless presence, to his soft babbling and that childlike self-absorbed twittering which sounded as if they came from the margin of our own time. During that period he used to disappear for many days into some distant corner of the house and it was difficult to locate him.

   Gradually these disappearances ceased to make any impression on us, we became used to them and when, after many days, father reappeared a few inches shorter and much thinner, we did not stop to think about it. We did not count him as one of us any more, so very remote had he become from everything that was human and real. Knot by knot, he loosened himself from us, point by point he gave up the ties joining him to the human community.

   What still remained of him-the small shroud of his body and the handful of nonsensical oddities-would finally disappear one day, as unremarked as the grey heap of rubbish swept into a corner, waiting to be taken by Adela to the rubbish dump. 


BIRDS

CAME THE YELLOW DAYS of winter, filled with boredom. The rust-coloured earth was covered with a threadbare, meagre tablecloth of snow full of holes. There was not enough of it for some of the roofs and so they stood there, black and brown, shingle and thatch, arks containing the sooty expanses of attics-coal-black cathedrals, bristling with ribs of rafters, beams and spars-the dark lungs of winter winds. Each dawn revealed new chimney stacks and chimney pots which had emerged during the hours of darkness, blown up by the night winds: the black pipes of a Devil's organ. The chimney-sweeps could not get rid of the crows which in the evening covered the branches of the trees around the church with living black leaves, then took off, fluttering, and came back, each clinging to its own place on its own branch, only to fly away at dawn in large flocks, like gusts of soot, flakes of dirt, undulating and fantastic, blackening with their insistent crowing the musty-yellow streaks of light. The days hardened with cold and boredom like last year's loaves of bread. One began to cut them with blunt knives without appetite, with a lazy indifference.    Father had stopped going out. He banked up the stoves, studied the ever elusive essence of fire, experienced the salty, metallic taste and the smoky smell of wintry flames, the cool caresses of salamanders that licked the shiny soot in the throat of the chimney. He applied himself lovingly at that time to all manner of small repairs in the upper regions of the rooms. At all hours of the day one could see him crouched on top of a ladder, working at something under the ceiling, at the cornices over the tall windows, at the counter-weights and chains of the hanging lamps. Following the custom of house painters, he used a pair of steps as enormous stilts and he felt perfectly happy in that bird's eye perspective close to the sky, leaves and birds painted on the ceiling. He grew more and more remote from practical affairs. When my mother, worried and unhappy about his condition, tried to draw him into a conversation about business, about the payments due at the end of the month, he listened to her absentmindedly, anxiety showing in his abstracted look. Sometimes he stopped her with a warning gesture of the hand in order to run to a corner of the room, put his ear to a crack in the floor and, by lifting the index finger of both hands, emphasise the gravity of the investigation, and begin to listen intently. At that time we did not yet understand the sad origin of these eccentricities, the deplorable complex which had been maturing in him.

   Mother had no influence over him, but he gave a lot of respectful attention to Adela. The cleaning of his room was to him a great and important ceremony, of which he always arranged to be a witness, watching all Adela's movements with a mixture of apprehension and pleasurable excitement. He ascribed to all her functions a deeper, symbolic meaning. When, with young firm gestures, the girl pushed a long-handled broom along the floor, father could hardly bear it. Tears would stream from his eyes, silent laughter transformed his face and his body was shaken by spasms of delight. He was ticklish to the point of madness. It was enough for Adela to waggle her fingers at him to imitate tickling, for him to rush through all the rooms in a wild panic, banging the doors after him, to fall at last flat on the bed in the furthest room and wriggle in convulsions of laughter, imagining the tickling which he found irresistible. Because of this, Adela's power over father was almost limitless.

   At that time we noticed for the first time father's passionate interest in animals. To begin with, it was the passion of the huntsman and the artist rolled into one. It was almost perhaps a deeper, biological sympathy of one creature for kindred, yet different forms of life, a kind of experimenting in the unexplored regions of existence. Only at a later stage did matters take that uncanny, complicated, essentially sinful and unnatural turn, which it is better not to bring into the light of day. But it all began with the hatching out of birds' eggs.

   With a great outlay of effort and money, father imported from Hamburg, or Holland, or from zoological stations in Africa, birds' eggs on which he set enormous broody hens from Belgium. It was a process which fascinated me as well-this hatching out of the chicks, which were real anomalies of shape and colour. It was difficult to anticipate in these monsters with enormous, fantastic beaks which they opened wide immediately after birth, hissing greedily to show the backs of their throats, in these lizards with frail, naked bodies of hunchbacks, the future peacocks, pheasants, grouse or condors. Placed in cottonwool, in baskets, this dragon brood lifted blind, wall-eyed heads on thin necks, croaking voicelessly from their dumb throats. My father would walk along the shelves, dressed in a green baize apron like a gardener in a hothouse of cacti, and conjure up from nothingness these blind bubbles, pulsating with life, these impotent bellies receiving the outside world only in the form of food, these growths on the surface of life, climbing blindfold towards the light. A few weeks' later when these blind buds of matter burst open, the rooms were filled with the bright chatter and scintillating chirruping of its new inhabitants. The birds perched on the curtain pelmets, on the tops of wardrobes; they nestled in the tangle of tin branches and the metal scrolls of the hanging lamps.

   While father pored over his large ornithological textbooks and studied their coloured plates, these feathery phantasms seemed to rise from the pages and fill the rooms with colours, with splashes of crimson, strips of sapphire, verdigris and silver. At feeding time they formed a motley, undulating bed on the floor, a living carpet which at the intrusion of a stranger would fall apart, scatter into fragments, flutter in the air, and finally settle high under the ceilings. I remember in particular a certain condor, an enormous bird with a featherless neck, its face wrinkled and knobbly. It was an emaciated ascetic, a Buddhist lama, full of imperturbable dignity in its behaviour, guided by the rigid ceremonial of its great species. When it sat facing my father, motionless in the monumental position of ageless Egyptian idols, its eye covered with a whitish cataract which it pulled down sideways over its pupil to shut itself up completely in the contemplation of its dignified solitude-it seemed, with its stony profile, like an older brother of my father's. Its body and muscles seemed to be made of the same material, it had the same hard, wrinkled skin, the same desiccated bony face, the same horny deep eye sockets. Even the hands, strong in the joints, my father's long thick hands with their rounded nails, had their counterpart in the condor's claws. I could not resist the impression, when looking at the sleeping condor, that I was in the presence of a mummy-a dried out, shrunken mummy of my father. I believe that even my mother noticed this strange resemblance although we never discussed the subject. It is significant that the condor used my father's chamberpot.

   Not content with the hatching out of more and more new specimens, my father arranged the marriages of birds in the attic, he sent out matchmakers, he tied up eager attractive brides in the holes and crannies under the roof, and soon the roof of our house, an enormous double-ridged shingle roof, became a real birds' hostel, a Noah's ark to which all kinds of feathery creatures flew from far afield. Long after the liquidation of the birds' paradise, this tradition persisted in the avian world and during the period of spring migration our roof was besieged by whole flocks of cranes, pelicans, peacocks and sundry other birds. However, after a short period of splendour, the whole undertaking took a sorry turn.

   It soon became necessary to move my father to two rooms at the top of the house which had served as box rooms. We could hear from there, at dawn, the mixed clangour of birds' voices. The wooden walls of the attic rooms, helped by the resonance of the empty space under the gables, sounded with the roar, the flutterings, the crowing, the gurgling, the mating cries. For a few weeks father was lost to view. He only rarely came down to the flat and, when he did, we noticed that he seemed to have shrunk, to have become smaller and thinner. Occasionally forgetting himself, he would rise from his chair at table, wave his arms as if they were wings, and emit a long-drawn-out bird's call while his eyes misted over. Then, rather embarrassed, he would join us in laughing it off and try to turn the whole incident into a joke.

   One day, during spring cleaning, Adela suddenly appeared in father's birds' kingdom. Stopping in the doorway, she wrung her hands at the foetid smell that filled the room, the heaps of droppings covering the floor, the tables and the chairs. Without hesitation, she flung open a window and, with the help of a long broom, she prodded the whole mass of birds into life. A fiendish cloud of feathers and wings arose screaming and Adela, like a furious Maenad protected by the whirlwind of her thyrsus, danced the dance of destruction. My father, waving his arms in panic, tried to lift himself into the air with his feathered flock. Slowly the winged cloud thinned until at last Adela remained on the battlefield, exhausted and out of breath, along with my father who now, adopting a worried hang dog expression, was ready to accept complete defeat.

   A moment later, my father came downstairs-a broken man, an exiled king who had lost his throne and his kingdom.
   

TAILOR'S DUMMIES

THE AFFAIR OF THE BIRDS was the last colourful and splendid counter-offensive of fantasy which my father, that incorrigible improviser, that fencing-master of imagination, had led against the trenches and defence-works of a sterile and empty winter. Only now do I understand the lonely heroism with which he alone had waged war against the fathomless elemental boredom that strangled the city. Without any support, without recognition on our part, that strangest of men was defending the lost cause of poetry. He was like a magic mill, into the hoppers of which the bran of empty hours was poured, to reemerge flowering in all the colours and scents of Oriental spices. But, used to the splendid showmanship of that metaphysical conjuror, we were climbed to underrate the value of his sovereign magic which saved us from the lethargy of empty days and nights.
   Adela was not rebuked for her thoughtless and brutal vandalism. On the contrary, we felt a vile satisfaction, a disgraceful pleasure that father's exuberance had been curbed, for although we had enjoyed it to the full, we later ignominiously denied all responsibility for it. Perhaps in our treachery there was secret approval of the victorious Adela to whom we dimly ascribed some commission and assignment from forces of a higher order. Betrayed by us all, father retreated without a fight from the scenes of his recent glory. Without crossing swords, he surrendered to the enemy the kingdom of his former splendour. A voluntary exile, he took himself off to an empty room at the end of the passage and there immured himself in solitude.
We forgot him.

   We were beset again from all sides by the mournful greyness of the city which crept through the windows with the dark rash of dawn, with
the mushroom growth of dusk, developing into the shaggy fur of long winter nights. The wallpaper of the rooms, blissfully unconstrained in those former days and accessible to the multicoloured flights of the birds, closed in on itself and hardened, becoming engrossed in the monotony of bitter monologues.

   The chandeliers blackened and wilted like old thistles; now they hung dejected and ill-tempered, their glass pendants ringing softly whenever anybody groped their way through the dimly lit room. In vain did Adela put coloured candles in all the holders; they were a poor substitute for, a pale reflection of, those splendid illuminations which had so recently enlivened these hanging gardens. Oh, what a twittering had been there, what swift and fantastic flights cutting the air into packs of magic cards, sprinkling thick flakes of azure, of peacock and parrot green, of metallic sparkle, drawing lines and flourishes in the air, displaying coloured fans which remained suspended, long after flight, in the shimmering atmosphere. Even now, in the depth of the greyness, echoes and memories of brightness were hidden but nobody caught them, no clarinet drilled the troubled air.

Those weeks passed under the sign of a strange drowsiness.

   Beds unmade for days on end, piled high with bedding crumpled and disordered from the weight of dreams, stood like deep boats waiting to sail into the dank and confusing labyrinths of some dark starless Venice. In the bleakness of dawn, Adela brought us coffee. Lazily we started dressing in the cold rooms, in the light of a single candle reflected many times in black window panes. The mornings were full of aimless bustle, of prolonged searches in endless drawers and cupboards. The clacking of Adela's slippers could be heard all over the flat. The shop assistants lit the lanterns, took the large shop keys which mother handed them and went out into the thick swirling darkness. Mother could not come to terms with her dressing. The candles burnt smaller in the candlesticks. Adela disappeared somewhere into the furthest rooms or into the attic where she hung the washing. She was deaf to our calling. A newly lit, dirty, bleak fire in
the stove licked at the cold, shiny growth of soot in the throat of the chimney. The candle died out, and the room filled with gloom. With our heads on the tablecloth, among the remains of breakfast, we fell asleep, still half-dressed. Lying face downward on the furry lap of darkness, we sailed in its regular breathing into the starless nothingness. We were awakened by Adela's noisy tidying up. Mother could not cope with her dressing. Before she had finished doing her hair, the shop-assistants were back for lunch. The halflight in the market place was now the colour of golden smoke. For a moment it looked as if out of that smoke-coloured honey, that opaque amber, a most beautiful afternoon would unfold. But the happy moment passed, the amalgam of dawn withered, the swelling fermentation of the day, almost completed, receded again into a helpless greyness. We assembled again around the table, the shop assistants rubbed their hands, red from the cold, and the prose of their conversation suddenly revealed a fullgrown day, a grey and empty Tuesday, a day without tradition and without a face. But it was only when a dish appeared on the table containing two large fish in jelly lying side by side, head to tail, like a sign of the Zodiac, that we recognised in them the coat of arms of that day the calendar emblem of the nameless Tuesday: we shared it out quickly among ourselves, thankful that the day had at last achieved an identity.

   The shop assistants ate with unction, with the seriousness due to a calendar feast. The smell of pepper filled the room. And when they had used pieces of bread to wipe up the remains of the jelly from their plates, pondering in silence on the heraldry of the following days of the week, and nothing remained on the serving dish but the fishheads with their boiled out eyes, we all felt that by a communal effort we had conquered the day and that what remained of it did not matter.

   And, in fact, Adela made short work of the rest of the day, now surrendered to her mercies. Amidst the clatter of saucepans and splashing of cold water, she was energetically liquidating the few hours remaining until dusk, while mother slept on the sofa. Meanwhile, in
the dining room the scene was being set for the evening. Polda and Pauline, the sewing girls, spread themselves out there with the props of their trade. Carried on their shoulders, a silent immobile lady had entered the room, a lady of oakum and canvas, with a black wooden knob instead of a head. But when stood in the corner between the door and the stove, that silent woman became mistress of the situation. Standing motionless in her corner, she supervised the girls' advances and wooing as they knelt before her, fitting fragments of a dress marked with white tacking thread. They waited with attention and patience on the silent idol, which was difficult to please. That moloch was inexorable as only a female moloch can be, and sent them back to work again and again, and they, thin and spindly, like wooden spools from which thread is unwound and as mobile, manipulated with deft fingers the piles of silk and cloth, cut with noisy scissors into its colourful mass, whirred the sewing machine, treading its pedal with one cheap patent-leathered foot, while around them there grew a heap of cuttings, of motley rags and pieces like husks and chaff spat out by two fussy and prodigal parrots. The curved jaws of the scissors tapped open like the beaks of those exotic birds.

   The girls trod absentmindedly on the bright shreds of material, wading carelessly in the rubbish of a possible carnival, in the lumber room of some great, unrealized masquerade. They disentangled themselves with nervous giggles from the trimmings, their eyes laughed into the mirrors. Their hearts, the quick magic of their fingers, were not in the boring dresses which remained on the table, but in the thousand scraps, the frivolous and fickle trimmings, with the colourful fantastic snowstorm with which they could smother the whole city.

   Suddenly they felt hot and opened the window to see, in the frustration of their solitude, in their hunger for new faces, at least one nameless face pressed against the pane. They fanned their flushed cheeks with the winter night air in which the curtains billowed-they uncovered their burning decolletes, full of hatred and rivalry for one another, ready to fight for any Pierrot whom the dark breezes of night
might blow in through the window. Ah! how little did they demand from reality! They had everything within themselves, they had a surfeit of everything in themselves. Ah! they would be content with a sawdust Pierrot with the long-awaited word to act as the cue for their wellrehearsed roles, so that they could at last speak the lines, full of a sweet and terrible bitterness, that crowded to their lips exciting them violently like some novel devoured at night while the tears streamed down their cheeks.

   During one of his nightly wanderings about the flat, undertaken in Adela's absence, my father stumbled upon such a quiet evening sewing session. For a moment he stood in the dark door of the adjoining room, a lamp in his hand, enchanted by the scene of feverish activity, by the blushes-that synthesis of face-powder, red tissue-paper and atropine-to which the winter night, breathing on the waving window curtains acted as a significant backdrop. Putting on his glasses, he stepped quickly up to the girls and walked twice around them, letting fall on them the light of the lamp he was carrying. The draught from the open door lifted the curtains; the girls let themselves be admired, twisting their hips; the enamel of their eyes glinted like the shiny leather of their shoes and the buckles of their garters, showing from under their skirts lifted by the wind; the scraps began to scamper across the floor like rats towards the half-closed door of the dark room and my father gazed attentively at the panting girls, whispering softly: "Genus avium . . . If I am not mistaken, scansores or pistacci . . . very remarkable, very remarkable indeed."

   This accidental encounter was the beginning of a whole series of meetings, in the course of which my father succeeded in charming both of the young ladies with the magnetism of his strange personality. In return for his witty and elegant conversation, which filled the emptiness of their evenings, the girls permitted the ardent ornithologist to study the structure of their thin and ordinary little bodies. This took place while the conversation was in progress and was done with a seriousness and grace which ensured that even the more risky points
of these researches remained completely unequivocal. Pulling Pauline's stocking down from her knee and studying with enraptured eyes the precise and noble structure of the joint, my father would say:

   "How delightful and happy is the form of existence which you ladies have chosen. How beautiful and simple is the truth which is revealed by your lives. And with that mastery, with what precision you are performing your task. If, forgetting the respect due to the Creator, I were to attempt a criticism of creation, I would say 'Less matter, more form!' Ah, what relief it would be for the world to lose some of its contents. More modesty in aspirations, more sobriety in claims, Gentlemen Demiurges, and the world would be more perfect!" my father exclaimed, which his hands released Pauline's white calf from the prison of her stocking.

   At that moment Adela appeared in the open door of the dining room, the supper tray in her hands. This was the first meeting of the two enemy powers since the great battle. All of us who witnessed it felt a moment of terrible fear. We felt extremely uneasy at being present at the further humiliation of the sorely tried man. My father rose from his knees very disturbed, blushing more and more deeply in wave after wave of shame. But Adela found herself unexpectedly equal to the situation. She walked up to father with a smile, and flipped him on the nose. At that, Polda and Pauline clapped their hands, stamped their feet and each grabbing one of father's arms, began to dance with him round the table. Thus, because of the girls? good nature, the cloud of unpleasantness dispersed in general hilarity.

   That was the beginning of a series of most interesting and most unusual lectures which my father, inspired by the charm of that small and innocent audience, delivered during the subsequent weeks of that early winter.

   It is worth noting how, in contact with that strange man, all things reverted, as it were, to the roots of their existence, rebuilt their outward appearance anew from their metaphysical core, returned to the primary idea, in order to betray it at some point and to turn into the doubtful,
risky and equivocal regions which we shall call for short the Regions of the Great Heresy. Our Heresiarch walked meanwhile like a mesmerist, infecting everything with his dangerous charm. Am I to call Pauline his victim? She became in those days his pupil and disciple, and at the same time a guinea-pig for his experiments.

   Next I shall attempt to explain, with due care and without causing offence, this most heretical doctrine which held father in its sway for many months to come and which during this time prompted all his actions.

TREATISE ON TAILORS' DUMMIES
or
THE SECOND BOOK OF GENESIS

"The Demiurge," said my father, "has had no monopoly of creation, for creation is the privilege of all spirits. Matter has been given infinite fertility, inexhaustible vitality and, at the same time, a seductive power of temptation which invites us to create as well. In the depth of matter, indistinct smiles are shaped, tensions build up, attempts at form appear. The whole of matter pulsates with infinite possibilities which send dull shivers through it. Waiting for the life-giving breath of the spirit, it is endlessly in motion. It entices us with a thousand sweet, soft, round shapes which it blindly dreams up within itself.

   "Deprived of all initiative, indulgently acquiescent, pliable like a woman, submissive to every impulse, it is a territory outside any law, open to all kinds of charlatans and dilettanti, a domain of abuses and of dubious demiurgical manipulations. Matter is the most passive and most defenceless essence in cosmos. Anyone can mould it and shape it; it obeys everybody. All attempts at organising matter are transient and temporary, easy to reverse and to dissolve. There is no evil in reducing life to other and newer forms. Homicide is not a sin. It is sometimes a necessary violence on resistant and ossified forms of existence which have ceased to be amusing. In the interests of an important and fascinating experiment, it can even become meritorious. Here is the starting point of a new apologia for sadism. "

   My father never tired of glorifying this extraordinary element- matter.

   "There is no dead matter," he taught us, "lifelessness is only a disguise behind which hide unknown forms of life. The range of these forms is infinite and their shades and nuances limitless. The Demiurge was in possession of important and interesting creative recipes. Thanks to them he created a multiplicity of species, which renew themselves by their own devices. No one knows whether these recipes will ever be reconstructed. But this is unnecessary, because even if the classical methods of creation should prove inaccessible for evermore, there still remain some illegal methods, an infinity of heretical and criminal methods. "

   As my father proceeded from these general principles of cosmogony to the more restricted sphere of his private interests, his voice sank to an impressive whisper, the lecture became ever more complicated and difficult to follow and the conclusions which he reached became more dubious and dangerous. His gestures acquired an esoteric solemnity. He half-closed one eye, put two fingers to his forehead while a look of extraordinary slyness came over his face. He transfixed his listeners with these looks, violated with his cynical expression their most intimate and most private reserve, until he had reached them in the furthest corner whither they had retreated, pressed them against the wall and tickled them with the finger of irony, finally producing a glimmer of understanding laughter, the laughter of agreement and admission, the visible sign of capitulation.

   The girls sat perfectly still, the lamp smoked, the piece of material under the needle of the sewing machine had long since slipped to the floor, and the machine ran empty, stitching only the black, starless cloth unwinding from the bale of winter darkness outside the window.

   "We have lived for too long under the terror of the matchless perfection of the Demiurge," my father said. "For too long the perfec
tion of his creation has paralysed our own creative instinct. We don't wish to compete with him. We have no ambition to emulate him. We wish to be creators in our own, lower sphere; we want to have the privilege of creation, we want creative delights, we want- in one word-Demiurgy. " I don't know on whose behalf my father was proclaiming these demands, what community or corporation, sect or order supported him loyally and lent the necessary weight to his words. As for us, we did not share these demiurgical aspirations.

   But father had meanwhile developed the programme of this second Demiurgy, the picture of the second Genesis of creatures which was to stand in open opposition to the present era.

   "We are not concerned," he said, "with long-winded creations, with long-term beings. Our creatures will not be heroes of romances in many volumes. Their roles will be short, concise; their characters- without a background. Sometimes for one gesture, for one word alone, we shall make the effort to bring them to life. We openly admit: we shall not insist either on durability or solidity of workmanship; our creations will be temporary, to serve for a single occasion. If they be human beings, we shall give them, for example, only one profile, one hand, one leg, the one limb needed for their role. It would be pedantic to bother about the other, unnecessary, leg. Their backs can be made of canvas or simply whitewashed. We shall have this proud slogan as our aim: a different actor for every gesture. For each action, each word, we shall call to life a different human being. Such is our whim, and the world will be run according to our pleasure. Demiurge was in love with consummate, superb and complicated materials; we shall give priority to trash. We are simply entranced and enchanted by the cheapness, shabbiness and inferiority of material."

   "Can you understand," asked my father, "the deep meaning of that weakness, that passion for coloured tissue, for papier mache, for distemper, for oakum and sawdust? This is," he continued with a pained smile, "the proof of our love for matter as such, for its fluffiness or porosity, for its unique mystical consistency. Demiurge, that great
master and artist, made matter invisible, made it disappear under the surface of life. We, on the contrary, love its creaking, its resistance, its clumsiness. We like to see behind each gesture, behind each move, its inertia, its heavy effort, its bear-like awkwardness."

   The girls sat motionless, with glazed eyes. Their faces were long and stultified by listening, their cheeks flushed, and it would have been difficult to decide at that moment whether they belonged to the first or the second Genesis of Creation.

   "In one word," father concluded, "we wish to create man a second time, in the shape and semblance of a tailor's dummy."

   Here, for reasons of accuracy, we must describe an insignificant small incident which occurred at that point of the lecture and to which we do not attach much importance. The incident, completely nonsensical and incomprehensible in the sequence of events, could probably be explained as vestigial automatism, without cause and effect, as an instance of the malice of inanimate objects transferred into the region of psychology. We advise the reader to treat it as lightly as we are doing. Here is what happened.

   Just as my father pronounced the word "dummy," Adela looked at her wristwatch and exchanged a knowing look with Polda. She then moved her chair forward and, without getting up from it, lifted her dress to reveal her foot tightly covered in black silk, and then stretched it out stiffly like a serpent's head.

   She sat thus throughout that scene, upright, her large eyes, shining from atropine, fluttering, while Polda and Pauline sat at her sides. All three looked at father with wide open eyes. My father coughed nervously, fell silent and suddenly became very red in the face. Within a minute the lines of his face, so expressive and vibrant a moment before, became still and his expression became humble.

   He-the inspired heresiarch, just emerging from the clouds of exaltation-suddenly collapsed and folded up. Or perhaps he had been exchanged for another man? That other man now sat stiffly, very flushed, with downcast eyes. Polda went up to him and bent over him.
Patting him lightly on the back, she spoke in the tone of gentle encouragement: "Jacob must be sensible. Jacob must obey, Jacob must not be obstinate. Please, Jacob . . . Please . . ."

   Adela's outstretched slipper trembled slightly and shone like a serpent's tongue. My father rose slowly, still looking down, took a step forward like an automaton, and fell to his knees. The lamp hissed in the silence of the room, eloquent looks ran up and down in the thicket of wallpaper patterns, whispers of venomous tongues floated in the air, zigzags of thought....

TREATISE ON TAILORS' DUMMIES
CONTINUATION

The next evening father reverted with renewed enthusiasm to his dark and complex subject. Each wrinkle of his deeply lined face expressed incredible cunning. In each fold of skin, a missile of irony lay hidden. But occasionally inspiration widened the spirals of his wrinkles and they swelled horribly and sank in silent whorls into the depths of the winter night.

   "Figures in a wax-work museum," he began, "even fair-ground parodies of dummies, must not be treated lightly. Matter never makes jokes: it is always full of the tragically serious. Who dares to think that you can play with matter, that you can shape it for a joke, that the joke will not be built in, will not eat into it like fate, like destiny? Can you imagine the pain, the dull imprisoned suffering, hewn into the matter of that dummy which does not know why it must be what it is, why it must remain in that forcibly imposed form which is no more than a parody? Do you understand the power of form, of expression, of pretense, the arbitrary tyranny imposed on a helpless block, and ruling it like its own, tyrannical, despotic soul? You give a head of canvas and oakum an expression of anger and leave it with it, with the convulsion, the tension enclosed once and for all, with a blind fury for which there is no outlet. The crowd laughs at the parody. Weep, ladies,
over your own fate, when you see the misery of imprisoned matter, of tortured matter which does not know what it is and why it is, nor where the gesture may lead that has been imposed on it for ever.

   "The crowd laughs. Do you understand the terrible sadism, the exhilarating, demiurgical cruelty of that laughter? Yet we should weep, ladies, at our own fate, when we see that misery of violated matter, against which a terrible wrong has been committed. Hence the frightening sadness of all those jesting Golems, of all effigies which brood tragically over their comic grimaces.

   "Look at the anarchist Luccheni, the murderer of the Empress Elizabeth of Austria; look at Draga, the diabolical and unhappy Queen of Serbia, look at that youth of genius, the hope and pride of his ancient family, ruined by the unfortunate habit of masturbation. Oh, the irony of those names, of those pretensions!

   "Is there anything left of Queen Draga in the wax-figure likeness, any similarity, even the most remote shadow of her being? But the resemblance, the pretence, the name reassures us and stops us from asking what that unfortunate figure is in itself and by itself. And yet it must be somebody, somebody anonymous, menacing and unhappy, some being that in its dumb existence had never heard of Queen Draga....

   "Have you heard at night the terrible howling of these wax figures, shut in their fair-booths; the pitiful chorus of those forms of wood or porcelain, banging their fists against the walls of their prisons?"

   In my father's face, convulsed by the horror of the visions which he had conjured up from darkness, a spiral of wrinkles appeared, a maelstrom growing deeper and deeper, at the bottom of which there flared the terrible eye of a prophet. His beard bristled grotesquely, the tufts of hair growing from warts and moles and from his nostrils stood on end. He became rigid and stood with flaming eyes, trembling from an internal conflict like an automaton of which the mechanism has broken down.

Adela rose from her chair and asked us to avert our eyes from
what was to follow. Then she went up to father and, with her hands on his hips in a pose of great determination, she spoke very clearly.

   The two other girls sat stiffly, with downcast eyes, strangely numb . . .

TREATISE ON TAILORS' DUMMIES
CONCLUSION

On one of the following evenings, my father continued his lecture thus: "When I announced my talk about lay figures, I had not really wanted to speak about those incarnate misunderstandings, those sad parodies that are the fruits of a common and vulgar lack of restraint. I had something else in mind."

   Here my father began to set before our eyes the picture of that generatio aequivoca which he had dreamed up, a species of beings only half organic, a kind of pseudo-fauna and pseudo-flora, the result of a fantastic fermentation of matter.

   They were creations resembling, in appearance only, living creatures such as crustaceans, vertebrates, cephalopods. In reality the appearance was misleading-they were amorphous creatures, with no internal structure, products of the imitative tendency of matter which, equipped with memory, repeats from force of habit the forms already accepted. The morphological scope of matter is limited on the whole and a certain quota of forms is repeated over and over again on various levels of existence.

   These creatures-mobile, sensitive to stimuli and yet outside the pale of real life-could be brought forth by suspending certain complex colloids in solutions of kitchen salt. These colloids, after a number of days, would form and organise themselves in precipitations of substance resembling lower forms of fauna.

   In creatures conceived in this way, one could observe the processes of respiration and metabolism, but chemical analysis revealed in them neither traces of albumen nor of carbon compounds.
   Yet these primitive forms were unremarkable compared with the richness of shapes and the splendour of the pseudo-fauna and the pseudo-flora, which sometimes appeared in certain strictly defined environments, such as old apartments saturated with the emanations of numerous existences and events; used up atmospheres rich in the specific ingredients of human dreams; rubbish heaps, abounding in the humus of memories, of nostalgia and of sterile boredom. On such a soil, this pseudo-vegetation sprouted abundantly yet ephemerally, brought forth short-lived generations which flourished suddenly and splendidly, only to wilt and perish.

   In apartments of that kind, wallpapers must be very weary and bored with the incessant changes in all the cadenzas of rhythm; no wonder that they are susceptible to distant, dangerous dreams. The essence of furniture is unstable, degenerate and receptive to abnormal temptations: it is then that on this sick, tired and wasted soil colourful and exuberant mildew can flourish in a fantastic growth, like a beautiful rash.

   "As you will no doubt know," said my father, "in old apartments there are rooms which are sometimes forgotten. Unvisited for months on end, they wilt neglected between the old walls and it happens that they close in on themselves, become overgrown with bricks and, lost once and for all to our memory, forfeit their only claim to existence. The doors, leading to them from some backstairs landing, have been overlooked by people living in the flat for so long that they merge with the wall, grow into it, and all trace of them is obliterated in a complicated design of lines and cracks.

   "Once early in the morning towards the end of winter," my father continued, "after many months of absence, I entered such a forgotten passage, and I was amazed at the appearance of the rooms.

   "From all the crevices in the floor, from all the mouldings, from every recess, there grew slim shoots filling the grey air with a scintillating filigree lace of leaves: a hot-house jungle, full of whispers and flicking lights-a false and blissful spring. Around the bed, under the lamp, along the wardrobes, grew clumps of delicate trees which, high above, spread their luminous crowns and fountains of lacy leaves, spraying cholorphyl, and thrusting up to the painted heaven of the ceiling. In the rapid process of blossoming, enormous white and pink flowers opened among the leaves, bursting from bud under your very eyes, displaying their pink pulp and spilling over to shed their petals and fall apart in quick decay.

   "I was happy," said my father, "to see that unexpected flowering which filled the air with a soft rustle, a gentle murmur, falling like coloured confetti through the thin rods of the twigs.

   "I could see the trembling of the air, the fermentation of too rich an atmosphere which provoked that precocious blossoming, luxuriation and wilting of the fantastic oleanders which had filled the room with a rare, lazy snowstorm of large pink clusters of flowers.

   "Before nightfall," concluded my father, "there was no trace left of that splendid flowering. The whole elusive sight was a Data Morgana, an example of the strange make-believe of matter which had created a semblance of life."

   My father was strangely animated that day; the expression in his eyes-a sly, ironic expression-was vivid and humorous. Later he suddenly became more serious and again analysed the infinite diversity of forms which the multifarious matter could adopt. He was fascinated by doubtful and problematic forms, like the ectoplasm of a medium, by pseudo-matter, the cataleptic emanations of the brain which in some instances spread from the mouth of the person in a trance over the whole table, filled the whole room, a floating, rarefied tissue, an astral dough, on the borderline between body and soul.

   "Who knows," he said, "how many suffering, crippled, fragmentary forms of life there are, such as the artificially created life of chests and tables quickly nailed together, crucified timbers, silent martyrs to cruel human inventiveness. The terrible transplantation of incompatible and hostile races of wood, their merging into one misbegotten personality.

   "How much ancient suffering is there in the varnished grain, in the veins and knots of our old familiar wardrobes? Who would recognise in them the old features, smiles and glances, almost planed and polished out of all recognition?"

   My father's face, when he said that, dissolved into a thoughtful net of wrinkles, began to resemble an old plank full of knots and veins, from which all memories had been planed away. For a moment we thought that father would fall into a state of apathy which sometimes took hold of him, but all of a sudden he recovered himself and continued to speak:

   "Ancient, mythical tribes used to embalm their dead. The walls of their houses were filled with bodies and heads immured in them: a father would stand in a corner of the drawing room- stuffed, the tanned skin of a deceased wife would serve as a mat under the table. I knew a certain sea captain who had in his cabin a lamp, made by Malayan embalmers from the body of his murdered mistress. On her head, she wore enormous antlers. In the stillness of the cabin, the face stretched between the antlers at the ceiling, slowly lifted its eyelids: on the half-opened lips a bubble of saliva would glint, then burst with the softest of whispers. Octopuses, tortoises, and enormous crabs, hanging from the rafters in place of chandeliers, moved their legs endlessly in that stillness, walking, walking, walking without moving .

   My father's face suddenly assumed a worried, sad expression when his thoughts, stirred by who knows what associations, prompted him to new examples:

   "Am I to conceal from you," he said in a low tone, "that my own brother, as a result of a long and incurable illness, has been gradually transformed into a bundle of rubber tubing, and that my poor cousin had to carry him day and night on his cushion, singing to the luckless creature endless lullabies on winter nights? Can there by anything sadder than a human being changed into the rubber tube of an enema? What disappointment for his parents, what confusion for their feelings,
what frustration of the hopes centered round the promising youth! And yet, the faithful love of my poor cousin was not denied him even during that transformation."

   "Oh, please, I cannot, I really cannot listen to this any longer!" groaned Polda leaning over her chair. "Make him stop, Adela . . ."

   The girls got up, Adela went up to my father with an outstretched finger made as if to tickle him. Father lost countenance, immediately stopped talking and, very frightened, began to back away from Adela's moving finger. She followed him, however, threatening him with her finger, driving him, step by step, out of the room. Pauline yawned and stretched herself. She and Polda, leaning against one another, exchanged a look and a smile.
   
   
CINNAMON SHOPS

AT THE TIME of the shortest, sleepy winter days, edged on both sides with the furry dusk of mornings and evenings, when the city reached out ever deeper into the labyrinth of winter nights, and was shaken reluctantly into consciousness by the short dawn, my father was already lost, sold and surrendered to the other sphere.
   His face and head became overgrown with a wild and recalcitrant shock of grey hair, bristling in irregular tufts and spikes, shooting out from warts, from his eyebrows, from the openings of his nostrils and giving him the appearance of an old ill-tempered fox.
   His sense of smell and his hearing sharpened extraordinarily and one could see from the expression of his tense silent face that through the intermediary of these two senses he remained in permanent contact with the unseen world of mouseholes, dark corners, chimney vents and dusty spaces under the floor.
   He was a vigilant and attentive observer, a prying fellow-conspirator, of the rustlings, the nightly creakings, the secret gnawing life of the floor. He was so engrossed in it that he became completely submerged in an inaccessible sphere and one which he did not even attempt to discuss with us.
   He often used to flip his fingers and laugh softly to himself when the manifestations of the unseen became too absurd; he then exchanged knowing looks with our cat which, also initiated in these mysteries, would lift its cynical cold striped face, closing the slanting chinks of its eyes with an air of indifference and boredom.
   It sometimes happened that, during a meal, my father would suddenly put aside his knife and fork and, with his napkin still tied around his neck, would rise from the table with a feline movement, tiptoe to the door of the adjoining room and peer through the key-hole with the utmost caution. Then, with a bashful smile, he would return to the table slightly embarrassed, murmuring and whispering indistinctly in tune with the interior monologue that wholly preoccupied him.
   To provide some distraction for him and to tear him away from these morbid speculations, my mother would force him to go out for a walk in the evenings. He went in silence, without protest but also without enthusiasm, distrait and absent in spirit. Once we even went all together to the theatre.
   We found ourselves again in that large, badly lit, dirty hall, full of somnolent human chatter and aimless confusion. But when we had made our way through the crowd, there emerged before us an enormous pale blue curtain, like the sky of another firmament. Large, painted pink masks, with puffed up cheeks floated in a huge expanse of canvas. The artificial sky spread out in both directions, swelling with the powerful breath of pathos and of great gestures, with the atmosphere of that fictitious floodlit world created on the echoing scaffoldings of the stage. The tremor sailing across the large area of that sky, the breath of the vast canvas which made the masks revive and grow, revealed the illusory character of that firmament, caused that vibration of reality which, in metaphysical moments, we experience as the glimmer of revelation.
   The masks fluttered their red eyelids, their coloured lips whispered voicelessly and I knew that the moment was imminent when the tension of mystery would reach its zenith and the swollen skies of the curtain would really burst open to reveal incredible and dazzling events.
   But I was not allowed to experience that moment, because in the meantime my father had begun to betray a certain anxiety. He was feeling in all his pockets and at last declared that he had left behind at home a wallet containing money and certain most important documents.
   After a short conference with my mother, during which Adela's honesty was submitted to a hasty assessment, it was suggested that I should go home to look for the wallet. According to my mother, there was still plenty of time before the curtain rose and, fleet-footed as I was, I had every chance of returning in time. I stepped into a winter night bright from the illuminations of the sky. It was one of those clear nights when the starry firmament is so wide and spreads so far that it seems to be divided and broken up into a mass of separate skies, sufficient for a whole month of winter nights and providing silver and painted globes to cover all the nightly phenomena, adventures, occurrences and carnivals.
   It is exceedingly thoughtless to send a young boy out on an urgent and important errand into a night like that because in its semiobscurity the streets multiply, becoming confused and interchanged. There open up, deep inside a city, reflected streets, streets which are doubles, make-believe streets. One's imagination, bewitched and misled, creates illusory maps of the apparently familiar districts, maps in which the streets have their proper places and usual names but are provided with new and fictitious configurations by the inexhaustible inventiveness of the night. The temptations of such winter nights begin usually with the innocent desire to take a shortcut, to use a quicker but less familiar way. Attractive possibilities arise of shortening a complicated walk by taking some never used side street. But on that occasion things began differently.
   Having taken a few steps, I realised that I was not wearing my overcoat. I wanted to turn back, but after a moment that seemed to me an unnecessary waste of time, especially as the night was not cold at all; on the contrary, I could feel waves of an unseasonal warmth, like breezes of a spring night. The snow shrank into a white fluff, into a harmless fleece smelling sweetly of violets. Similar white fluffs were sailing across the sky on which the moon was doubled and trebled, showing all its phases and positions at once.
   On that night the sky laid bare its internal construction in many sections which, like quasi-anatomical exhibits showed the spirals and whorls of light, the pale green solids of darkness, the plasma of space, the tissue of dreams.
   On such a night, it was impossible to walk along Rampart Street or any other of the dark streets which are the obverse, the lining as it were, of the four sides of Market Square, and not to remember that at that late hour the strange and most attractive shops were sometimes open, the shops which on ordinary days one tended to overlook. I used to call them cinnamon shops because of the dark panelling of their walls.
   These truly noble shops, open late at night, have always been the objects of my ardent interest. Dimly lit, their dark and solemn interiors were redolent of the smell of paint, varnish and incense; of the aroma of distant countries and rare commodities. You could find in them Bengal lights, magic boxes, the stamps of long forgotten countries, Chinese transfers, indigo, calaphony from Malabar, the eggs of exotic insects, parrots, toucans, live salamanders and basilisks, mandrake roots, mechanical toys from Nuremberg, homunculi in jars, microscopes, binoculars and most especially strange and rare books, old folio volumes full of astonishing engravings and amazing stories.
   I remember those old dignified merchants who served their customers with downcast eyes, in discreet silence, and who were full of wisdom and tolerance for their customers' most secret whims. But most of all, I remember a bookshop in which I once glanced at some rare and forbidden pamphlets, the publications of secret societies lifting the veil on tantalizing and unknown mysteries.
   I so rarely had the occasion to visit these shops-especially with a small but sufficient amount of money in my pocket-that I could not forgo the opportunity I had now, in spite of the important mission entrusted to me.
   According to my calculations I ought to turn into a narrow lane and pass two or three side streets in order to reach the street of the night shops. This would take me even further from home, but by cutting across Saltworks Street, I could make good the delay.
   Lent wings by my desire to visit the cinnamon shops, I turned into a street I knew and ran rather than walked, anxious not to lose my way. I passed three or four streets, but still there was no sign of the turning I wanted. What is more, the appearance of the street was different from what I had expected. Nor was there any sign of the shops. I was in a street of houses with no doors and of which the tightly shut windows were blind from reflected moonlight. On the other side of those houses-I thought-must run the street from which they were accessible. I was walking faster now, rather disturbed, beginning to give up the idea of visiting the cinnamon shops. All I wanted now was to get out of there quickly into some part of the city I knew better. I reached the end of the street, unsure where it would lead me. I found myself in a broad, sparsely built avenue, very long and straight. I felt on me the breath of a wide open space. Close to the pavement or in the midst of their gardens, picturesque villas stood there, the private houses of the rich. In the gaps between them were parks and walls of orchards. The whole area looked like Lesznianska Street in its lower and rarely visited part. The moonlight filtered through a thousand feathery clouds like silver scales on the sky. It was pale and bright as daylight-only the parks and gardens stood black in that silvery landscape.
   Looking more closely at one of the buildings, I realised that what I saw was the back of the high school which I had never seen from that side. I was just approaching the gate which, to my surprise, was open; the entrance hall was lit. I walked in and found myself on the red carpet of the passage. I hoped to be able to slip through unobserved and come out through the front gate, thus taking a splendid shortcut.
   I remembered that at that late hour there might be, in Professor Arendt's classroom, one of the voluntary classes which in winter were always held in the late evenings and to which we all flocked, fired by the enthusiasm for art which that excellent teacher had awakened in us.
   A small group of industrious pupils was almost lost in the large dark hall on whose walls the enormous shadows of our heads broke abruptly, thrown by the light of two small candles set in bottles.
   To be truthful, we did not draw very much during these classes and the Professor was not very exacting. Some boys brought cushions from home and stretched themselves out on forms for a short nap. Only the most diligent of us gathered around the candle, in the golden circle of its light.
   We usually had to wait a long while for the Professor's arrival, filling the time with sleepy conversation. At last the door from his room would open and he would enter-short, bearded, given to esoteric smiles and discreet silences and exuding an aroma of secrecy. He shut the door of his study carefully behind him: through it for a brief moment we could see over his head a crowd of plaster shadows, the classical fragments of suffering Niobides, Danaids and Tantalides, the whole sad and sterile Olympus, wilting for years on end in that plaster-cast museum. The light in his room was opaque even in daytime, thick from the dreams of plaster-cast heads, from empty looks, ashen profiles and meditations dissolving into nothingness. We liked to listen sometimes in front of that door-listen to the silence laden with the sighs and whispers of the crumbling gods withering in the boredom and monotony of their twilight.
   The Professor walked with great dignity and unction up and down among the half-empty forms in which, in small groups, we were drawing amidst the grey reflections of a winter night. Everything was quiet and cosy. Some of my class-mates were asleep. The candles were burning low in their bottles. The Professor delved into a deep bookcase, full of old folios, unfashionable engravings, woodcuts and prints. He showed us, with his esoteric gestures, old lithographs of night landscapes, of tree clumps in moonlight, of avenues in wintry parks outlined black on the white moonlit background.
   Amidst sleepy talk, time passed unnoticed. It ran by unevenly, as if making knots in the passage of hours, swallowing somewhere whole empty periods. Without transition, our whole gang found ourselves on the way home long after midnight on the garden path white with snow, flanked by the black, dry thicket of bushes. We walked alongside that hairy rim of darkness, brushing against the furry bushes, their lower branches snapping under our feet in the bright night, in a false milky brightness. The diffuse whiteness of light filtered by the snow, by the pale air, by the milky space, was like the grey paper of an engraving on which the thick bushes corresponded to the deep black lines of decoration. The night was copying now, at that late hour, the nightly landscapes of Professor Arendt's engravings, re-enacting his fantasies.
   In the black thickets of the park, in the hairy coat of bushes, in the mass of crusty twigs there were nooks, niches, nests of deepest fluffy blackness, full of confusion, secret gestures, conniving looks. It was warm and quiet there. We sat on the soft snow in our heavy coats, cracking hazel nuts of which there was a profusion in that spring-like winter. Through the copse, weasels wandered silently, martens and ichneumons, furry, ferreting elongated animals on short legs, stinking of sheepskin. We suspected that among them were the exhibits from the school cabinets which, although degutted and moulting, felt on that white night in their empty bowels the voice of the eternal instinct, the mating urge, and returned to the thickets for short moments of illusory life.
   But slowly the phosphorescence of the spring-like snow became dulled: it vanished then, giving way to a thick black darkness preceding dawn. Some of us fell asleep in the warm snow, others went groping in the dark for the doors of their houses and walked blindly into the sleep of their parents and brothers, into a continuation of deep snoring which caught up with them on their late return.
   These nightly drawing sessions held a secret charm for me, so that now I could nest forgo the opportunity of looking for a moment into the art room. I decided however that I would not stop for more than a little while. But walking up the back stairs, their cedar wood resounding under my steps, I realised that I was in a wing of the school building completely unknown to me. Not even a murmur interrupted the solemn silence. The passages were broader in this wing, covered with a thick carpet and most elegant. Small, darkly glowing lamps were hung at each corner. Turning the first of these, I found myself in an even wider, more sumptuous hall. In one of its walls there was a wide glass arcade leading to the interior of an apartment. I could see a long enfilade of rooms, furnished with great magnificence. The eye wandered over silk hangings, gilded mirrors, costly furniture and crystal chandeliers and into the velvety softness of the luxurious interiors, shimmering with lights, entangled garlands and budding flowers. The profound stillness of these empty rooms was filled with the secret glances exchanged by mirrors and the panic of friezes running high along the walls and disappearing into the stucco of the white ceilings.
   I faced all that magnificence with admiration and awe, guessing that my nightly escapade had brought me unexpectedly into the Headmaster's wing, to his private apartment. I stood there with a beating heart, rooted to the spot by curiosity, ready to escape at the slightest noise. How would I justify, if surprised, that nocturnal visit, that impudent prying? In one of those deep plush armchairs there might sit, unobserved and still, the young daughter of the Headmaster. She might lift her eyes to mine black, Sybilline, quiet eyes, the gaze of which none could hold. But to retreat half-way, not having carried through the plan I had, would be cowardly. Besides, deep silence reigned in those magnificent interiors, lit by the hazy light of an undefined hour. Through the arcades of the passage, I saw on the far side of the drawing room a large glass door leading to the terrace. It was so still everywhere that I felt suddenly emboldened. It did not strike me as too risky to walk down the short steps leading to the level of the drawing room, to take a few quick steps across the large costly carpet and to find myself on the terrace from which I could get back without any difficulty to the familiar street.
   This is what I did. When I found myself on the parquet floor under the potted palms that reached up to the frieze of the ceiling. I noticed that now I really was on neutral ground, because the drawing room did not have a front wall. It was a kind of large loggia, connected by a few steps with a city square, an enclosed part of the square, because some of the garden furniture stood directly on the pavement. I ran down the short flight of stone steps and found myself at street level once more.
   The constellations in the sky stood steeply on their heads, all the stars had made an about turn, but the moon, buried under the featherbed of clouds which were lit by its unseen presence, seemed still to have before her an endless journey and, absorbed in her complicated heavenly procedures, did not think of dawn.
   A few horse-drawn cabs loomed black in the street, half-broken and loose-jointed like crippled, dozing crabs or cockroaches. A driver leaned down towards me from his high box. He had a small, red, kindly face, "Shall we go, master?" he asked. The cab shook in all the joints and ligatures of its many-limbed body and made a start on its light wheels.
   But who would entrust oneself on such a night to the whims of an unpredictable cabby? Amidst the click of the axles, amidst the thud of the box and the roof, I could not agree with him on my destination. He nodded indulgently at everything I said and sang to himself. We drove in a circle around the city.
   In front of an inn stood a group of cabbies who waved friendly hands to him. He answered gaily and then, without stopping the carriage, he threw the reins on my knees, jumped down from the box and joined the group of his colleagues. The horse, an old, wise cab-horse, looked round cursorily and went on in a monotonous regular trot. In fact, that horse inspired confidence- it seemed smarter than its driver. But I myself could not drive so I had to rely on the horse's will. We turned into a suburban street, bordered on both sides by gardens. As we advanced, these gardens slowly changed into parks with tall trees and the parks in turn into forests.
   I shall never forget that luminous journey on that brightest of winter nights. The coloured map of the heavens expanded into an immense dome, on which there loomed fantastic lands, oceans and seas, marked with the lines of stellar currents and eddies, with the brilliant streaks of heavenly geography. The air became light to breathe and shimmered like silver gauze. One could smell violets. From under the white woolly lambskin of snow, trembling anemones appeared with a speck of moonlight in each delicate cup. The whole forest seemed to be illuminated by thousands of lights and by the stars falling in profusion from the December sky. The air pulsated with a secret spring, with the matchless purity of snow and violets. We entered a hilly landscape. The lines of hills, bristling with the bare spikes of trees, rose like sighs of bliss. I saw on these happy slopes groups of wanderers, gathering among the moss and the bushes the fallen stars which now were damp from snow. The road became steep, the horse began to slip on it and pulled the creaking cab only with an effort. I was happy. My lungs soaked up the blissful spring in the air, the freshness of snow and stars. Before the horse's breast the rampart of white snowy foam grew higher and higher, and it could hardly wade through that pure fresh mass. At last we stopped. I got out of the cab. The horse was panting, hanging its head. I hugged its head to my breast and saw that there were tears in its large eyes. I noticed a round black wound on its belly. "Why did not you tell me?" I whispered, crying. "My dearest, I did it for you," the horse said and became very small, like a wooden toy. I left him and felt wonderfully light and happy. I was debating whether to wait for the small local train which passed through here or to walk back to the city. I began to walk down a steep path, winding like a serpent amidst the forest; at first in a light, elastic step; later, passing into a brisk, happy run which became gradually faster, until it resembled a gliding descent on skis. I could regulate my speed at will and change course by light movements of my body.
   On the outskirts of the city, I slowed this triumphal run and changed it into a sedate walk. The moon still rode high in the sky. The transformations of the sky, the metamorphoses of its multiple domes into ever more complicated configurations were endless. Like a silver astrolabe the sky disclosed on that magic night its internal mechanism and showed in infinite evolutions the mathematics of its cogs and wheels.
   In the market square I met some people enjoying a walk. All of them, enchanted by the displays of that night, walked with uplifted faces, silvery from the magic of the sky. I completely stopped worrying about father's wallet. My father, absorbed by his manias, had probably forgotten its loss by now, and as for my mother, I did not much care.
   On such a night, unique in the year, one has happy thoughts and inspirations, one feels touched by the divine finger of poetry. Full of ideas and projects, I wanted to walk towards my home, but met some school friends with books under their arms. They were on their way to school already, having been wakened by the brightness of that night that would not end.
   We went for a walk all together along a steeply falling street, pervaded by the scent of violets; uncertain whether it was the magic of the night which lay like silver on the snow or whether it was the light of dawn...
