This is the beginning of the IvanCode project (so named because of a similarity to the Ivanhoe Game 
conceived by Jerome McGann and Johanna Drucker).

In this project, we're going to try and reverse engineer three of the novels that we've read this semester.

In other words, our task is to treat these texts as software, and then produce the imaginary source code that, when
compiled and executed, would produce the novel we read. 

Think of these code documents as algorithmic Pierre Menards.
